144.625	  Experiment
145.622	 Details
146.809	  This
147.032	 experiment
147.924	 consists
148.371	 of
148.594	 ten
148.817	 matches.
150.476	  Prior
150.858	 to
151.048	 start
151.239	 of
151.430	 the
151.621	 experiment,
152.571	 all
152.799	 participants
153.713	 may
153.942	 be
154.170	 split
154.399	 into
154.856	 two
155.084	 groups.
156.504	 The
156.694	 groups
156.884	 will
157.074	 stay
157.264	 fixed
157.454	 and
157.644	 you
157.833	 will
158.023	 know
158.213	 number
158.593	 of
158.783	 participants
159.543	 in
159.733	 your
159.923	 group
160.113	 throughout
160.492	 the
160.682	 experiment.
162.641	  At
162.854	 the
163.067	 beginning
163.705	 of
163.918	 each
164.131	 match,
164.535	 you
164.727	 will
164.919	 be
165.111	 paired
165.303	 randomly
165.880	 with
166.072	 one
166.264	 other
166.648	 participant
167.417	 from
167.609	 your
167.801	 group.
169.190	 You
169.373	 will
169.556	 remain
169.922	 matched
170.106	 with
170.289	 this
170.472	 same
170.655	 participant
171.387	 until
171.753	 the
171.937	 end
172.120	 of
172.303	 the
172.486	 match,
172.873	 but
173.058	 then
173.243	 will
173.428	 be
173.612	 paired
173.797	 with
173.982	 another
174.537	 randomly
175.091	 selected
175.646	 participant
176.385	 from
176.570	 your
176.755	 group
176.940	 in
177.125	 the
177.310	 following
177.864	 match.
179.234	 Each
179.486	 match
179.739	 will
179.991	 have
180.243	 the
180.495	 same
180.748	 structure,
181.443	  but
181.628	 may
181.813	 contain
182.183	 different
182.737	 numbers
183.107	 of
183.292	 periods.
185.046	  You
185.205	 will
185.364	 remain
185.682	 anonymous
186.319	 throughout
186.637	 the
186.796	 experiment.
188.631	 You
188.807	 will
188.983	 not
189.160	 know
189.336	 the
189.512	 identity
190.217	 of
190.393	 the
190.569	 participant
191.274	 that
191.450	 you
191.626	 are
191.803	 paired
191.979	 with,
192.346	 and
192.511	 they
192.677	 will
192.842	 not
193.008	 know
193.173	 your
193.338	 identity.
195.192	  The
195.441	 choices
195.939	 made
196.187	 by
196.436	 you,
196.867	 and
197.050	 the
197.234	 participant
197.968	 you
198.152	 are
198.335	 paired
198.519	 with,
198.892	 have
199.100	 no
199.307	 effect
199.722	 on
199.930	 the
200.137	 payoffs
200.552	 of
200.760	 participants
201.590	 in
201.797	 other
202.212	 pairs,
202.602	 and
202.839	 vice
203.075	 versa.
204.712	 Therefore,
205.617	 your
205.806	 payoff
206.183	 in
206.372	 a
206.561	 given
206.938	 match
207.127	 is
207.316	 based
207.504	 solely
207.882	 on
208.071	 the
208.259	 choices
208.637	 made
208.825	 by
209.014	 you
209.203	 and
209.392	 the
209.580	 participant
210.335	 that
210.524	 you
210.713	 are
210.902	 paired
211.090	 with.
212.470	  Next,
213.258	 Let's
213.443	 Look
213.627	 at
213.812	 the
213.997	 experimental
214.920	 Interface
218.164	 Specific

219.428	 for
219.639	 Each
219.850	 Period
221.168	 Your
221.354	 payoff
221.727	 in
221.913	 each
222.099	 period
222.657	 will
222.844	 depend
223.216	 on
223.402	 your
223.588	 choice
223.774	 and
223.961	 the
224.147	 choice
224.333	 of
224.519	 the
224.705	 participant
225.450	 that
225.636	 you
225.822	 are
226.009	 paired
226.195	 with.
227.568	 You
227.792	 will
228.016	 choose
228.239	 one
228.463	 of
228.687	 two
228.910	 options,
229.549	 either
229.960	 W
230.577	 or
230.782	 Y.
231.972	 You
232.151	 will
232.330	 be
232.509	 able
232.867	 to
233.047	 see
233.226	 the
233.405	 payoffs
233.763	 for
233.942	 each
234.121	 combination
234.837	 of
235.017	 choices
235.375	 for
235.554	 you
235.733	 and
235.912	 the

236.808	 that
236.987	 you
237.166	 are
237.345	 paired
237.524	 with.
238.907	 These
239.100	 payoffs
239.486	 will
239.679	 remain
240.065	 the

634.838	 Similarly,
635.860	 given
636.207	 the
636.380	 above
636.727	 history,
637.437	 we
637.654	 can
637.872	 see

691.302	 Additionally,
692.352	 you

692.716	 to
692.898	 select
693.262	 the
693.445	  First
693.627	 Period
694.173	 rule.
695.539	 The
695.735	 first

697.885	 the
698.081	 first
698.276	 period
698.863	 of
699.058	 the
699.254	 match.
700.657	 To
700.846	 select
701.224	 your
701.413	 first
701.602	 period
702.169	 rule
702.359	 select

708.083	  Additional
708.877	 Examples
710.161	 In
710.350	 the
710.540	 example
711.108	 above,
711.669	  Rule
711.965	 #4,
713.053	 and
713.318	  Rule
713.582	 #9,
714.582	 both
714.796	 fit
715.010	 the
715.224	 history.
717.072	 However,
717.906	 rule
718.106	 #9
718.705	 will
718.905	 be
719.104	 selected
719.704	 because
720.103	 it
720.303	 is
720.503	 longer.
722.092	 Therefore,
723.002	  W
723.565	 will
723.753	 be
723.941	 played
724.129	 in
724.316	 the
724.504	 next
724.692	 period,
725.441	  as
725.705	 prescribed
726.234	 by
726.498	 rule
726.763	 #9.
728.757	 For
728.955	 the
729.153	 example
729.747	 above,
730.340	 how
730.562	 can
730.784	 we
731.007	 change
731.229	 the
731.451	 rule
731.673	 set
731.896	 to
732.118	 ensure
732.562	 that
732.784	 Y
733.007	 is
733.229	 played
733.451	 next
733.673	 period.
735.521	 There
735.733	 are
735.944	 several
736.367	 ways
736.579	 to
736.790	 make
737.002	 changes
737.425	 to
737.637	 the
737.848	 rule
738.060	 set
738.271	 in
738.483	 order
738.906	 for
739.118	 Y
739.329	 to
739.541	 be
739.752	 played.
741.161	 First,
741.883	 you
742.122	 can
742.361	 delete
742.839	  Rule
743.078	 #9,
743.978	 which
744.196	 would
744.414	 cause
744.632	  Rule
744.851	 #4
745.505	 to
745.723	 be
745.941	 the
746.160	 longest
746.596	 rule
746.814	 that
747.032	 fits
747.250	 the
747.469	 history,
748.298	  and
748.506	 therefore
748.921	 would
749.129	 lead
749.337	 to
749.544	 Y
749.752	 being
750.167	 played
750.375	 next
750.583	 period.
757.392	  Second,
758.173	 you
758.369	  can
758.565	 add
758.761	 a
758.957	 longer
759.348	 rule
759.544	 that
759.740	 fits
759.936	 the
760.132	 history
760.720	 that
760.916	 has
761.112	 Y
761.307	 as
761.503	 the
761.699	 output.
763.282	 Since
763.490	 you
763.698	 added
764.114	 a
764.322	 longer
764.739	 rule
764.947	 that
765.155	 fits
765.363	 the
765.571	 history,
766.371	 that
766.618	 rule
766.865	 will
767.111	 be
767.358	 used
767.605	 to
767.852	 make
768.098	 the
768.345	 choice,
768.770	 and
768.971	 will
769.171	 select
769.572	 Y
769.773	 as
769.974	 the
770.174	 choice
770.375	 for
770.576	 next
770.776	 period.
778.063	  Number
778.496	 of
778.712	 Periods
779.362	 Per
779.578	 Match
780.491	 The
780.665	 number
781.013	 of
781.187	 periods
781.709	 in
781.883	 each
782.057	 match
782.231	 will
782.405	 be
782.579	 determined
783.102	 randomly
783.624	 using
783.972	 the
784.146	 following
784.668	 procedure.
786.388	 At
786.571	 the
786.754	 end
786.937	 of
787.119	 each
787.302	 period,
788.041	  a
788.250	 number
788.668	 will
788.877	 be
789.085	 chosen
789.503	 randomly
790.130	 from
790.339	 the
790.548	 set
790.756	 of
790.965	 numbers
791.383	  {1,2,3,
793.829	 up
794.164	 to,48,49,50},
797.889	 where
798.082	 each
798.275	 number
798.661	 is
798.854	 equally
799.433	 likely.
801.010	  If
801.241	 the
801.472	 number
801.935	 is
802.166	 1,
802.590	 then
802.824	 the
803.059	 match
803.293	 will
803.528	 end.
804.948	  If
805.185	 the
805.422	 number
805.895	 is
806.132	 not
806.369	 1,
806.802	 then
807.012	 the
807.223	 match
807.433	 will
807.644	 continue.
809.456	 The
809.657	 number
810.058	 will
810.259	 always
810.660	 be
810.861	 placed
811.062	 back
811.263	 into
811.664	 the
811.865	 set
812.065	 after
812.467	 it
812.668	 is
812.868	 drawn.
814.250	 Thus,
814.928	 in
815.128	 any
815.529	 period
816.131	 there
816.331	 is
816.532	 a
816.732	 2
816.932	 percent
817.333	 CHANCE
817.534	 that
817.734	 the
817.935	 match
818.135	 will
818.336	 end,
818.724	 and
818.913	 a
819.102	 98
819.668	 percent
820.046	 CHANCE
820.235	 that
820.424	 the
820.612	 match
820.801	 will
820.990	 have
821.179	 another
821.745	 period.
823.499	 Therefore,
824.408	  the
824.604	 expected
825.190	 number
825.581	 of
825.777	 periods
826.363	 in
826.559	 each
826.754	 match
826.950	 will
827.145	 be
827.341	 50.
828.919	  This
829.112	 procedure
829.693	 has
829.886	 been
830.079	 performed
830.466	 on
830.660	 the
830.853	 computer
831.433	 before
831.820	 the
832.013	 experiment.
833.974	 Therefore,
834.879	 you
835.062	 will
835.244	 not
835.427	 see
835.609	 the
835.792	 number
836.157	 selected
836.704	 from
836.887	 {1,2,3,
839.337	 up
839.671	 to,48,49,50}.
844.336	 To

846.146	 is
846.347	 not
846.548	 dependent
847.152	 on
847.353	 your
847.554	 play,
847.929	 the
848.112	 number
848.479	 of
848.663	 periods
849.213	 for
849.397	 each
849.580	 match
849.764	 has

1090.484	 Therefore,
1091.391	 it
1091.589	 is
1091.788	 useful
1092.185	 to
