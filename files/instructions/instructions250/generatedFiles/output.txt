143.460	  Experiment
144.388	 Details
145.551	  This
145.774	 experiment
146.667	 consists
147.114	 of
147.337	 ten
147.560	 matches.
149.221	  Prior
149.628	 to
149.831	 start
150.034	 of
150.238	 the
150.441	 experiment,
151.432	 all
151.660	 participants
152.574	 may
152.803	 be
153.031	 split
153.259	 into
153.716	 two
153.945	 groups.
155.363	 The
155.554	 groups
155.744	 will
155.935	 stay
156.126	 fixed
156.317	 and
156.507	 you
156.698	 will
156.889	 know
157.079	 the
157.270	 number
157.651	 of
157.842	 participants
158.605	 in
158.796	 your
158.986	 group
159.177	 throughout
159.558	 the
159.749	 experiment.
161.681	  At
161.891	 the
162.101	 beginning
162.732	 of
162.942	 each
163.152	 match,
163.557	 you
163.747	 will
163.936	 be
164.126	 paired
164.315	 randomly
164.884	 with
165.073	 one
165.263	 other
165.642	 participant
166.400	 from
166.590	 your
166.779	 group.
168.282	 You
168.473	 will
168.664	 remain
169.045	 matched
169.236	 with
169.427	 this
169.618	 same
169.808	 participant
170.571	 until
170.953	 the
171.144	 end
171.335	 of
171.525	 the
171.716	 match,
172.117	 but
172.296	 then
172.476	 will
172.655	 be
172.834	 paired
173.013	 with
173.193	 another
173.731	 randomly
174.268	 selected
174.806	 participant
175.523	 from
175.703	 your
175.882	 group
176.061	 in
176.241	 the
176.420	 following
176.958	 match.
178.325	 Each
178.581	 match
178.837	 will
179.093	 have
179.349	 the
179.605	 same
179.861	 structure,
180.528	  but
180.722	 may
180.916	 contain
181.304	 different
181.887	 numbers
182.275	 of
182.469	 periods.
184.252	  You
184.418	 will
184.584	 remain
184.916	 anonymous
185.581	 throughout
185.913	 the
186.079	 experiment.
187.927	 You
188.102	 will
188.277	 not
188.453	 know
188.628	 the
188.803	 identity
189.504	 of
189.679	 the
189.854	 participant
190.555	 that
190.730	 you
190.905	 are
191.081	 paired
191.256	 with,
191.619	 and
191.786	 they
191.954	 will
192.121	 not
192.288	 know
192.456	 your
192.623	 identity.
194.478	  The
194.714	 choices
195.186	 made
195.423	 by
195.659	 you,
196.089	 and
196.290	 the
196.490	 participant
197.293	 you
197.493	 are
197.694	 paired
197.894	 with,
198.293	 have
198.508	 no
198.722	 effect
199.151	 on
199.366	 the
199.580	 payoffs
200.009	 of
200.224	 participants
201.082	 in
201.296	 other
201.725	 pairs,
202.124	 and
202.365	 vice
202.606	 versa.
204.239	 Therefore,
205.170	 your
205.361	 payoff
205.742	 in
205.933	 a
206.124	 given
206.506	 match
206.696	 is
206.887	 based
207.078	 solely
207.460	 on
207.650	 the
207.841	 choices
208.223	 made
208.414	 by
208.604	 you
208.795	 and
208.986	 the
209.177	 participant
209.940	 that
210.131	 you
210.322	 are
210.512	 paired
210.703	 with.
212.074	  Next,
212.864	 Let's
213.051	 Look
213.237	 at
213.424	 the
213.611	 experimental
214.545	 Interface
217.794	 Specific
218.421	 Instructions
219.047	 for
219.256	 Each
219.465	 Period
220.781	 Your
220.977	 payoff
221.370	 in
221.567	 each
221.763	 period
222.353	 will
222.549	 depend
222.942	 on
223.139	 your
223.335	 choice
223.532	 and
223.728	 the
223.925	 choice
224.121	 of
224.318	 the
224.514	 participant
225.300	 that
225.497	 you
225.693	 are
225.890	 paired
226.086	 with.
227.469	 You
227.702	 will
227.935	 choose
228.169	 one
228.402	 of
228.635	 two
228.868	 options,
229.520	 either
229.943	 W
230.578	 or
230.789	 Y.
231.995	 You
232.179	 will
232.364	 be
232.548	 able
232.917	 to
233.101	 see
233.285	 the
233.470	 payoffs
233.838	 for
234.023	 each
234.207	 combination
234.945	 of
235.129	 choices
235.498	 for
235.682	 you
235.866	 and
236.051	 the

236.972	 that
237.157	 you
237.341	 are
237.525	 paired
237.710	 with.
239.081	 These
239.270	 payoffs
239.647	 will
239.836	 remain
240.214	 the
240.402	 same

240.969	 the
241.158	 entire
241.724	 experiment
243.175	 (all
243.457	 matches).
245.712	  The
245.903	 payoffs
246.285	 will
246.476	 be

635.953	 Similarly,
636.989	 given
637.336	 the
637.510	 above
637.856	 history,
638.556	 we
638.770	 can

698.766	 the
698.964	 first
699.161	 period
699.753	 of
699.950	 the

701.566	 To
701.753	 select
702.126	 your
702.312	 first
702.499	 period
703.058	 rule
703.245	 select

709.178	  Additional
709.988	 Examples
711.283	 In
711.474	 the
711.665	 example
712.237	 above,
712.794	  Rule
713.082	 #4,
714.129	 and
714.371	  Rule
714.614	 #9,
715.544	 both
715.763	 fit
715.982	 the
716.201	 history.
718.055	 However,
718.887	 rule
719.084	 #9
719.674	 will
719.871	 be
720.068	 selected
720.658	 because
721.052	 it
721.249	 is
721.445	 longer.
723.035	 Therefore,
723.982	  W
724.485	 will
724.653	 be
724.821	 played
724.988	 in
725.156	 the
725.324	 next
725.492	 period,
726.159	  as
726.405	 prescribed
726.897	 by
727.142	 rule
727.388	 #9.
729.309	 For
729.502	 the
729.695	 example
730.274	 above,
730.859	 how
731.077	 can
731.295	 we
731.514	 change
731.732	 the
731.950	 rule
732.168	 set
732.387	 to
732.605	 ensure
733.041	 that
733.259	 Y
733.478	 is
733.696	 played
733.914	 next
734.132	 period.
735.967	 There
736.180	 are
736.392	 several
736.818	 ways
737.031	 to
737.243	 make
737.456	 changes
737.881	 to
738.094	 the
738.307	 rule
738.520	 set
738.732	 in
738.945	 order
739.370	 for
739.583	 Y
739.796	 to
740.009	 be
740.221	 played.
741.612	 First,
742.352	 you
742.572	 can
742.792	 delete
743.232	  Rule
743.452	 #9,
744.299	 which
744.518	 would
744.737	 cause
744.956	  Rule
745.175	 #4
745.833	 to
746.052	 be
746.271	 the
746.490	 longest
746.928	 rule
747.147	 that
747.366	 fits
747.586	 the
747.805	 history,
748.635	  and
748.838	 therefore
749.245	 would
749.448	 lead
749.651	 to
749.854	 Y
750.057	 being
750.464	 played
750.667	 next
750.870	 period.
757.659	  Second,
758.440	 you
758.626	  can
758.812	 add
758.998	 a
759.184	 longer
759.557	 rule
759.743	 that
759.929	 fits
760.115	 the
760.301	 history
760.859	 that
761.045	 has
761.232	 Y
761.418	 as
761.604	 the
761.790	 output.
763.351	 Since
763.552	 you
763.754	 added
764.156	 a
764.357	 longer
764.760	 rule
764.961	 that
765.163	 fits
765.364	 the
765.565	 history,
766.350	 that
766.584	 rule
766.817	 will
767.051	 be
767.284	 used
767.518	 to
767.751	 make
767.985	 the
768.218	 choice,
768.613	 and
768.823	 will
769.034	 select
769.455	 Y
769.665	 as
769.876	 the
770.086	 choice
770.297	 for
770.507	 next
770.718	 period.
778.029	  Number
778.435	 of
778.638	 Periods
779.248	 Per
779.451	 Match
780.350	 The
780.528	 number
780.884	 of
781.062	 periods
781.595	 in
781.773	 each
781.951	 match
782.129	 will
782.307	 be
782.485	 determined
783.018	 randomly
783.552	 using
783.908	 the
784.086	 following
784.619	 procedure.
786.342	 At
786.525	 the
786.707	 end
786.890	 of
787.073	 each
787.256	 period,
787.968	  a
788.168	 number
788.569	 will
788.769	 be
788.969	 chosen
789.370	 randomly
789.970	 from
790.171	 the
790.371	 set
790.571	 of
790.771	 numbers
791.172	  {1,2,3,
793.616	 up
793.922	 to,48,49,50},
797.571	 where
797.769	 each
797.967	 number
798.363	 is
798.561	 equally
799.154	 likely.
800.728	  If
800.951	 the
801.173	 number
801.619	 is
801.841	 1,
802.230	 then
802.483	 the
802.736	 match
802.990	 will
803.243	 end.
804.656	  If
804.876	 the
805.097	 number
805.538	 is
805.758	 not
805.979	 1,
806.380	 then
806.611	 the
806.842	 match
807.073	 will
807.304	 continue.
809.176	 The
809.367	 number
809.750	 will
809.942	 always
810.325	 be
810.516	 placed
810.708	 back
810.899	 into
811.282	 the
811.473	 set
811.665	 after
812.048	 it
812.239	 is
812.431	 drawn.
813.791	 Thus,
814.476	 in
814.673	 any
815.068	 period
815.659	 there
815.857	 is
816.054	 a
816.251	 2
816.448	 percent
816.843	 CHANCE
817.040	 that
817.237	 the
817.434	 match
817.632	 will
817.829	 end,
818.185	 and
818.367	 a
818.549	 98
819.095	 percent
819.459	 CHANCE
819.641	 that
819.823	 the
820.005	 match
820.187	 will
820.369	 have
820.551	 another
821.097	 period.
822.829	 Therefore,
823.759	  the
823.950	 expected
824.525	 number
824.908	 of
825.099	 periods
825.674	 in
825.865	 each
826.057	 match
826.248	 will
826.440	 be
826.631	 50.
828.197	  This
828.385	 procedure
828.947	 has
829.135	 been
829.322	 performed
829.697	 on
829.885	 the
830.072	 computer
830.635	 before
831.010	 the
831.198	 experiment.
833.133	 Therefore,
834.061	 you
834.240	 will
834.418	 not
834.597	 see
834.776	 the
834.954	 number
835.311	 selected
835.847	 from
836.026	 {1,2,3,
838.441	 up
838.745	 to,48,49,50}.
843.334	 To

845.140	 is
845.340	 not
845.541	 dependent
846.143	 on
846.344	 your
846.544	 play,
846.906	 the
847.079	 number
847.424	 of
847.596	 periods
848.114	 for
848.286	 each
848.459	 match

1085.987	 need

1091.175	 Therefore,
1092.103	 it
1092.306	 is
1092.509	 useful
