var links=[[0.007,' Welcome  to  the  Vernon  Smith  Experimental  Economics  Laboratory  '],[4.913,'  Please  carefully  watch  these  video  instructions  and  follow  along  on  the  paper  copy  at  your  desk  '],[12.373,'  Experiment  Overview '],[14.879,'  You  are  about  to  participate  in  an  experiment  in  the  economics  of  decision making  '],[20.421,'  If  you  listen  carefully '],[22.022,'   you  could  earn  a  large  amount  of  money '],[23.979,'   that  will  be  paid  to  you  in  cash '],[26.080,'   in  private '],[26.951,'   at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[29.633,'  It  is  important  that  you  remain  silent  and  do  not  look  at  other  people\'s  work  '],[34.638,'  If  you  have  any  questions '],[36.202,'   or  need  any  assistance  of  any  kind '],[38.379,'   please  raise  your  hand  and  an  experimenter  will  help  you  out  '],[42.510,'  During  the  experiment '],[44.018,'   do  not  talk '],[45.056,'   laugh  or  exclaim  out  loud  and  be  sure  to  keep  your  eyes  on  your  screen  only  '],[50.296,'  In  addition '],[51.344,'   please  turn  off  your  cell  phones '],[53.264,'   etc  '],[55.064,'  and  put  them  away  during  the  experiment  '],[58.265,'  Anybody  that  violates  these  rules  will  be  asked  to  leave  and  will  not  be  paid  '],[63.388,'  We  expect '],[64.158,'   and  appreciate  your  cooperation  '],[67.663,'  Agenda '],[68.909,'  one  '],[71.069,'  We  will  first  go  over  the  instructions  '],[74.369,'  two  '],[76.454,'  Then  we  will  have  a  practice  match  to  learn  the  interface  '],[80.659,'  three  '],[82.834,'  Next '],[83.626,'   there  will  be  a  quiz  with  ten  questions  to  make  sure  everyone  understands  the  instructions  '],[90.621,'  All  ten  questions  will  refer  to  these  instructions  so  you  should  follow  them  carefully  '],[96.181,'  If  you  answer  all  questions  correctly  you  will  earn  ten  dollars  '],[101.758,'  If  you  answer  at  least  one  question  incorrectly  you  will  earn  nothing '],[105.523,'   at  which  point  you  will  not  need  to  answer  any  more  questions  '],[110.813,'  You  will  have  ten  minutes  to  answer  the  ten  questions  '],[114.620,'  four  '],[116.884,'  After  the  quiz '],[118.061,'   you  will  have  ten  minutes  to  prepare  for  the  experiment  '],[121.950,'  In  the  experiment  you  will  be  working  with  a  fictitious  currency  called  Francs  '],[127.371,'  You  will  be  paid  in  US  Dollars  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[131.835,'  The  exchange  rate  today  is '],[134.222,'  one thousand two hundred and fifty  Francs  equals  one  u s dollars  '],[143.460,'  Experiment  Details '],[145.551,'  This  experiment  consists  of  ten  matches  '],[149.221,'  Prior  to  start  of  the  experiment '],[151.432,'   all  participants  may  be  split  into  two  groups  '],[155.363,'  The  groups  will  stay  fixed  and  you  will  know  the  number  of  participants  in  your  group  throughout  the  experiment  '],[161.681,'  At  the  beginning  of  each  match '],[163.557,'   you  will  be  paired  randomly  with  one  other  participant  from  your  group  '],[168.282,'  You  will  remain  matched  with  this  same  participant  until  the  end  of  the  match '],[172.117,'   but  then  will  be  paired  with  another  randomly  selected  participant  from  your  group  in  the  following  match  '],[178.325,'  Each  match  will  have  the  same  structure '],[180.528,'   but  may  contain  different  numbers  of  periods  '],[184.252,'  You  will  remain  anonymous  throughout  the  experiment  '],[187.927,'  You  will  not  know  the  identity  of  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with '],[191.619,'   and  they  will  not  know  your  identity  '],[194.478,'  The  choices  made  by  you '],[196.089,'   and  the  participant  you  are  paired  with '],[198.293,'   have  no  effect  on  the  payoffs  of  participants  in  other  pairs '],[202.124,'   and  vice  versa  '],[204.239,'  Therefore '],[205.170,'   your  payoff  in  a  given  match  is  based  solely  on  the  choices  made  by  you  and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  '],[212.074,'  Next '],[212.864,'   Let\'s  Look  at  the  experimental  Interface '],[217.794,'  Specific  Instructions  for  Each  Period '],[220.781,'  Your  payoff  in  each  period  will  depend  on  your  choice  and  the  choice  of  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  '],[227.469,'  You  will  choose  one  of  two  options '],[229.520,'   either  W  or  Y  '],[231.995,'  You  will  be  able  to  see  the  payoffs  for  each  combination  of  choices  for  you  and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  '],[239.081,'  These  payoffs  will  remain  the  same  throughout  the  entire  experiment '],[243.175,'   all  matches   '],[245.712,'  The  payoffs  will  be  displayed  in  a  table  like  this '],[248.854,'  In  this  example  above '],[250.433,'   the  rows  are  the  following '],[252.471,'  Row   number one  '],[253.803,' Your  choice '],[255.728,'   either  W  or  Y  in  this  example  '],[259.063,'  Row   number two  '],[260.332,' Other\'s  choice '],[262.455,'   either  W  or  Y  in  this  example  '],[266.789,'  Row   number three  '],[268.018,' Your  payoff  '],[270.049,'  Row   number four  '],[271.353,' Other\'s  payoff  '],[273.507,'  Row   number five  '],[274.945,' Total  number  of  times  that  that  combination  has  been  played  this  match  '],[279.893,'  Examples '],[281.451,'  In  the  table  above '],[282.800,'   if  you  choose  W  and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  chooses  Y '],[287.086,'   then  you  receive  a  payoff  of  three '],[289.305,'   and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  receives  a  payoff  of  four  '],[294.090,'  This  combination  has  occurred  nineteen  times  so  far  this  match  '],[299.174,'  If  you  choose  W  and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  chooses  W '],[303.542,'   then  you  receive  a  payoff  of  seven '],[305.842,'   and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  receives  a  payoff  of  eight  '],[310.422,'  This  combination  has  occurred  six  times  so  far  this  match  '],[314.897,'  If  you  choose  Y  and  the  participant  you  are  paired  with  chooses  Y '],[318.826,'   then  you  receive  a  payoff  of  one '],[321.085,'   and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  receives  a  payoff  of  two  '],[325.800,'  This  combination  has  occurred  six  times  so  far  this  match  '],[330.788,'  History '],[332.126,'  As  the  match  progresses '],[333.721,'   you  will  see  the  history  of  play  across  the  top  of  the  screen '],[337.163,'   displayed  like  this '],[338.948,'  This  history  displays  the  period '],[341.623,'   labeled  Period  '],[343.318,'  your  choice  in  that  period '],[345.444,'   labeled  My  Choice  '],[347.241,'  the  choice  of  the  participant  you  are  paired  with  in  that  period '],[351.103,'   labeled  Other\'s  Choice  '],[353.176,'  and  the  payoff  for  that  period '],[355.501,'   labeled  My  Payoff   '],[358.372,'  For  example '],[359.488,'   in  the  above  history '],[360.889,'   in  period  thirty nine '],[362.656,'   you  played  W '],[364.043,'   the  participant  you  are  paired  with  played  Y '],[366.643,'   and  you  received  a  payoff  of  three  '],[370.242,'  Rules '],[371.569,'  Rather  than  directly  making  choices  of  W  or  Y '],[374.978,'   you  will  develop  a  set  of  rules  which  will  automatically  make  choices  for  you  '],[380.040,'  The  set  of  rules  will  appear  in  the  middle  of  the  screen  '],[383.841,'  You  will  be  able  to  construct  rules  using  the  rule  constructor  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen  '],[389.578,'  A  rule  consists  of  two  parts '],[391.978,'  Input  Sequence  '],[393.368,' A  sequence  of  choices  made  by  you  and  the  participant  you  are  paired  with  '],[398.466,'  Output  '],[399.242,' A  choice  to  be  made  by  you  after  the  input  sequence  occurs  '],[403.907,'  Some  example  rules  are  displayed  below '],[406.960,'  For  example '],[408.076,'   Rule   number two  has  an  input  sequence  of '],[411.078,'   Y '],[411.744,' Y  '],[413.627,'   W '],[414.482,' W  '],[416.233,'   Y '],[416.914,' W  '],[418.160,'  and  an  output  of  W  '],[420.631,'  This  means  that  if  you  have  played  Y '],[422.795,'   W '],[423.562,'   and  then  Y  in  the  last  three  periods '],[425.670,'   and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  has  played  Y '],[428.772,'   W '],[429.523,'   and  then  W '],[430.729,'   this  rule  will  lead  you  to  play  W  in  the  next  period  '],[434.991,'  As  play  progresses  you  will  develop  a  set  of  rules  that  will  be  used  to  make  your  choices  '],[440.958,'  Play  will  proceed  as  follows '],[443.344,'  Each  period '],[444.232,'   your  set  of  rules  will  select  the  choice  to  be  made  next  period  '],[448.841,'  The  rule  that  will  be  used  to  make  the  choice  will  be  highlighted  '],[452.955,'  The  corresponding  sequence  in  the  history  will  be  highlighted  '],[457.238,'  A  preview  of  the  choice  to  be  made  next  period  will  be  shown  as  a  lightly  colored  cell  on  the  history  of  play  '],[464.446,'  In  order  to  move  to  the  next  period '],[466.622,'   you  have  to  confirm  the  choice  by  clicking  on  the  corresponding  history  cell  '],[472.060,'  Once  you  have  confirmed  your  choice '],[474.128,'   the  light  color  will  turn  to  a  regular  color '],[476.785,'   and  you  may  need  to  wait  for  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  to  make  their  choice  '],[487.206,'  There  are  several  ways  that  you  can  modify  your  rules  during  the  experiment  '],[492.132,'  one  '],[494.311,'  First '],[495.051,'   you  can  use  the  rule  constructor  in  the  bottom  center  of  the  screen  '],[499.647,'  Press  the  plus  button  to  add  more  columns '],[502.227,'   or  one  of  the  minus  buttons  to  subtract  columns  '],[506.134,'  Click  on  the  question  marks  to  fill  in  the  boxes  '],[510.081,'  When  you  click  on  a  question  mark '],[512.092,'   either  a  W  or  a  Y  will  appear  '],[515.294,'  If  you  click  on  a  W '],[516.998,'   it  will  switch  to  a  Y '],[518.754,'   and  if  you  click  on  a  Y '],[520.427,'   it  will  switch  to  a  W  '],[523.020,'  Once  you  have  completely  filled  in  the  rule '],[525.953,'   leaving  no  question  marks  '],[528.254,'  the  add  rule  button  will  appear '],[530.168,'   and  the  rule  can  be  added  to  your  set  '],[533.243,'  two  '],[535.321,'  Second '],[536.098,'   if  you  look  at  a  rule  in  the  set '],[537.938,'   you  will  notice  a  green  copy  button '],[540.016,'   and  a  red  delete  button  '],[542.488,'  If  you  press  the  green  copy  button '],[544.577,'   it  will  copy  the  rule  down  to  the  constructor '],[547.150,'   and  you  will  be  able  to  create  a  similar  rule  '],[552.715,'  If  you  press  the  red  delete  button '],[554.645,'   it  will  delete  the  rule  from  the  set  '],[559.809,'  three  '],[561.987,'  Since  your  rule  set  needs  to  make  a  single  choice  each  period '],[565.313,'   it  is  not  possible  to  have  two  rules  with  the  same  input  sequence '],[569.354,'   but  with  different  outputs  '],[571.887,'  If  you  create  a  rule  that  has  the  same  input  sequence  but  a  different  output '],[576.062,'   you  will  get  an  error  that  says  Conflicting  rule  in  set '],[579.172,'   and  a  button  that  says  Switch  Rule  will  appear  '],[582.527,'  If  you  press  this  button '],[584.043,'   it  will  delete  the  conflicting  rule  from  the  rule  set '],[587.057,'   and  add  the  rule  from  the  constructor  '],[592.105,'  The  length  of  the  rule  is  measured  by  the  length  of  the  input  sequence  '],[596.800,'  So  rule   number two '],[598.304,'   and  rule   number three  have  a  length  of  three '],[600.751,'   and  rule   number four  has  a  length  of  two  '],[604.086,'  A  rule  of  length  n  is  said  to  fit  the  history  if  the  input  sequence  matches  the  last  n  periods  of  the  history  '],[611.365,'  For  example '],[612.484,'   since  the  last  three  periods  of  play  in  the  above  history '],[616.293,'   periods  forty two  through  forty four  '],[619.157,'  have  been '],[620.457,'   Y '],[621.124,'   Y  '],[623.007,'   W '],[623.861,'   W  '],[625.106,'  and '],[626.183,'   Y '],[626.864,'   W  '],[628.098,'  and  that  sequence  is  also  the  input  for  rule   number two '],[632.231,'  then  rule   number two  is  said  to  fit  the  history  '],[635.953,'  Similarly '],[636.989,'   given  the  above  history '],[638.556,'   we  can  see  that  rule   number four  fits  the  history '],[642.540,'  but  rule   number three  does  not  fit  the  history  '],[646.204,'  If  more  than  one  rule  fits  the  history '],[648.564,'   then  the  rule  with  the  longer  length  will  determine  the  choice  '],[652.855,'  For  example '],[653.995,'   given  the  above  history  since  both  rule   number two '],[656.996,'   and  rule   number four  fit  the  history '],[659.169,'   rule   number two  will  be  used  to  make  your  choice '],[661.724,'   since  it  is  longer  '],[664.078,'  Therefore '],[665.016,'   given  the  history '],[666.217,'   and  the  rule  set '],[667.360,'   your  choice  next  period  will  be  W '],[669.960,'   as  prescribed  by  rule   number two  '],[675.011,'  If  no  rules  fit  the  history '],[676.972,'   then  your  Default  Rule  will  be  selected  '],[680.480,'  The  default  rule  will  only  be  used  when  no  rules  fit  the  history  '],[685.368,'  To  select  your  default  rule  select  either  W '],[688.310,'   or  Y '],[689.176,'   in  the  bottom  left  of  your  screen  '],[692.070,'  Additionally '],[693.085,'   you  have  to  select  the  First  Period  rule  '],[696.398,'  The  first  period  rule  will  only  be  used  in  the  first  period  of  the  match  '],[701.566,'  To  select  your  first  period  rule  select  either  W '],[704.732,'   or  Y '],[705.597,'   in  the  bottom  left  of  your  screen  '],[709.178,'  Additional  Examples '],[711.283,'  In  the  example  above '],[712.794,'   Rule   number four '],[714.129,'   and  Rule   number nine '],[715.544,'   both  fit  the  history  '],[718.055,'  However '],[718.887,'   rule   number nine  will  be  selected  because  it  is  longer  '],[723.035,'  Therefore '],[723.982,'   W  will  be  played  in  the  next  period '],[726.159,'   as  prescribed  by  rule   number nine  '],[729.309,'  For  the  example  above '],[730.859,'   how  can  we  change  the  rule  set  to  ensure  that  Y  is  played  next  period  '],[735.967,'  There  are  several  ways  to  make  changes  to  the  rule  set  in  order  for  Y  to  be  played  '],[741.612,'  First '],[742.352,'   you  can  delete  Rule   number nine '],[744.299,'   which  would  cause  Rule   number four  to  be  the  longest  rule  that  fits  the  history '],[748.635,'   and  therefore  would  lead  to  Y  being  played  next  period  '],[757.659,'  Second '],[758.440,'   you  can  add  a  longer  rule  that  fits  the  history  that  has  Y  as  the  output  '],[763.351,'  Since  you  added  a  longer  rule  that  fits  the  history '],[766.350,'   that  rule  will  be  used  to  make  the  choice '],[768.613,'   and  will  select  Y  as  the  choice  for  next  period  '],[778.029,'  Number  of  Periods  Per  Match '],[780.350,'  The  number  of  periods  in  each  match  will  be  determined  randomly  using  the  following  procedure  '],[786.342,'  At  the  end  of  each  period '],[787.968,'   a  number  will  be  chosen  randomly  from  the  set  of  numbers   '],[791.369,' one '],[792.126,' two '],[792.846,' three '],[793.616,'   up  to '],[794.426,' forty eight '],[795.499,' forty nine '],[796.646,' fifty '],[797.571,'   where  each  number  is  equally  likely  '],[800.728,'  If  the  number  is  one '],[802.230,'   then  the  match  will  end  '],[804.656,'  If  the  number  is  not  one '],[806.380,'   then  the  match  will  continue  '],[809.176,'  The  number  will  always  be  placed  back  into  the  set  after  it  is  drawn  '],[813.791,'  Thus '],[814.476,'   in  any  period  there  is  a  two  percent  CHANCE  that  the  match  will  end '],[818.185,'   and  a  ninety eight  percent  CHANCE  that  the  match  will  have  another  period  '],[822.829,'  Therefore '],[823.759,'   the  expected  number  of  periods  in  each  match  will  be  fifty  '],[828.197,'  This  procedure  has  been  performed  on  the  computer  before  the  experiment  '],[833.133,'  Therefore '],[834.061,'   you  will  not  see  the  number  selected  from   '],[836.208,' one '],[836.951,' two '],[837.673,' three '],[838.441,'   up  to '],[839.250,' forty eight '],[840.324,' forty nine '],[841.483,' fifty '],[843.334,'  To  ensure  that  the  length  of  the  match  is  not  dependent  on  your  play '],[846.906,'   the  number  of  periods  for  each  match  has  be  written  on  the  board  before  the  experiment '],[851.240,'   and  will  be  uncovered  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[854.816,'  Your  choices  will  be  determined  automatically  from  your  rule  set  '],[859.187,'  However '],[860.020,'   you  will  need  to  confirm  the  choice  within  an  allotted  amount  of  time  '],[864.854,'  To  confirm  your  choice '],[866.563,'   click  on  your  action  for  the  next  period  within  the  history  at  the  top  of  the  screen  '],[871.984,'  If  you  don\'t  confirm  the  choice  within  the  allotted  amount  of  time '],[875.807,'   then  the  choice  will  be  confirmed  automatically  at  the  end  of  the  allotted  time  '],[880.833,'  The  experiment  will  not  be  able  to  proceed  until  everyone  confirms  their  choices  '],[886.557,'  Everyone  in  your  group  will  have  the  same  amount  of  time  allotted  in  each  period  '],[892.302,'  Additional  Information  about  Matches '],[895.120,'  During  matches  one  through  ten  you  will  be  able  to  construct  the  set  of  rules  to  make  your  choices  '],[901.404,'  All  of  the  rules  in  your  set  at  the  end  of  one  match  will  remain  in  your  set  at  the  start  of  the  next  match  '],[907.491,'  Before  the  first  match '],[909.030,'   you  will  have  one  minute  to  look  over  the  payoffs '],[911.435,'   and  an  additional  ten  minute  to  construct  your  rules  '],[915.781,'  Editing  your  set  of  rules '],[917.943,'  In  the  experiment  today  you  will  need  to  pay  a  cost  to  edit  rules  during  the  match  '],[923.345,'  More  specifically '],[924.792,'   Before  each  match  starts '],[926.577,'   you  can  make  changes  to  your  set  of  rules  at  no  cost  '],[930.500,'  After  each  match  starts '],[932.273,'   if  you  want  to  make  changes  to  your  set  of  rules '],[935.044,'   you  must  click  the  Unlock  Rules  button  '],[938.399,'  The  cost  for  clicking  the  Unlock  Rules  button  is  two hundred and fifty  Francs  '],[943.710,'  The  total  cost  incurred  in  all  matches  will  be  displayed  at  the  top  of  the  screen  in  red  '],[949.485,'  You  will  be  able  to  edit  your  rules  for  the  duration  of  one  period  '],[953.961,'  Once  you  are  done  editing  your  rules  you  may  click  the  Lock  Rules  button  '],[958.804,'  If  you  don\'t  want  to  make  changes  to  your  set  of  rules '],[961.906,'   you  may  choose  not  to  click  the  Unlock  Rule  button  '],[965.618,'  Then  you  will  not  incur  the  cost  of  two hundred and fifty  Francs  '],[969.959,'  In  either  case '],[971.032,'   you  will  need  to  confirm  the  choice  made  within  the  time  limit  set  for  each  period  '],[976.486,'  If  the  time  limit  within  a  period  is  reached '],[979.195,'   your  rules  will  become  locked '],[981.071,'   your  choice  will  be  confirmed  automatically '],[983.510,'   and  you  will  proceed  to  the  next  period  '],[987.292,'  Starting  Rules '],[989.093,'  Prior  to  the  start  of  the  experiment  you  will  have  ten  minutes  to  construct  your  starting  set  of  rules  '],[995.497,'  During  that  time '],[996.753,'   you  will  be  presented  with  a  split screen  view  of  of  the  construction  screen  '],[1001.631,'  In  this  view '],[1002.698,'   you  will  have  an  opportunity  to  test  what  your  rule  set  will  select  as  an  output  for  a  variety  of  hypothetical  histories  '],[1010.429,'  The  split screen  will  consist  of  two  sides  '],[1014.087,'  The  right  side  is  the  Starting  Rules  side  '],[1017.566,'  Rules  added  to  this  side  will  be  added  to  your  rule  set  at  the  start  of  the  first  match  '],[1023.250,'  The  left  side  is  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side  '],[1027.016,'  Rules  added  to  this  side  can  be  used  to  test  to  see  what  choices  different  combinations  of  rules  will  lead  to  '],[1034.085,'  You  will  be  able  to  move  rules  from  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side  to  the  Starting  Rules  side  by  clicking  the  blue  move  button  '],[1041.716,'  To  delete  rules  from  either  side '],[1043.971,'   you  need  to  click  the  delete  button  '],[1046.745,'  You  will  be  able  to  see  what  choice  your  hypothetical '],[1049.571,'   and  your  starting  rule  sets  select  as  a  choice  for  next  period '],[1053.072,'   for  each  of  the  hypothetical  histories  that  you  construct  '],[1057.411,'  Notice  that  you  will  be  able  to  construct '],[1059.831,'   and  store '],[1060.640,'   multiple  histories  at  the  same  time  '],[1064.159,'  You  can  view  one  of  the  other  hypothetical  histories  by  clicking  the  History   number   button  at  the  top  of  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side  '],[1072.382,'  You  can  add  a  new  hypothetical  history  by  clicking  the  New  button  at  the  top  of  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side  '],[1079.238,'  To  construct  a  hypothetical  history  you  will  need  to  click  on  the  question  marks  in  that  history  '],[1085.587,'  You  don\'t  need  to  fill  out  the  entire  history  to  see  what  choice  your  rule  set  will  make  '],[1091.175,'  Therefore '],[1092.103,'   it  is  useful  to  start  filling  out  the  new  histories  from  the  most  recent  periods  on  the  right  side  '],[1098.550,'  Let\'s  look  at  an  example  '],[1101.234,'  Five  periods  of  hypothetical  History   number four  have  been  filled  in  '],[1106.370,'  The  hypothetical  rule  set  will  play  W  after  this  history  occurs  '],[1111.684,'  The  starting  rule  set  will  play  Y  after  this  history  occurs  '],[1121.484,'  Let\'s  look  at  another  example  '],[1124.401,'  fourteen  periods  of  hypothetical  History   number three  have  been  filled  in  '],[1129.882,'  The  hypothetical  rule  set  will  play  Y  after  this  history  occurs  '],[1135.161,'  The  starting  rule  set  will  play  Y  after  this  history  occurs  '],[1144.962,'  You  will  be  able  to  make  changes  to  your  Hypothetical  Rules '],[1148.314,'   and  your  Starting  Rules '],[1149.846,'   for  the  duration  of  the  ten  minutes  '],[1152.863,'  After  the  ten  minutes  are  up '],[1154.554,'   rules  that  are  on  the  Starting  Rules  side  will  be  your  starting  rules  for  the  experiment  '],[1160.717,'  Payoffs '],[1161.975,'  At  the  end  of  the  experiment '],[1163.773,'   you  will  be  paid  in  cash  '],[1166.331,'  Your  payoff  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  will  be  the  sum  of  the  payoffs  for  each  period  '],[1171.800,'  Reminder '],[1172.707,'   the  exchange  rate  today  is  one thousand two hundred and fifty  Francs  equals  one  dollar  '],[1179.061,'  Practice  Match '],[1180.701,'  Next '],[1181.493,'   there  will  be  a  practice  match  to  make  sure  that  you  are  comfortable  with  the  interface  '],[1186.831,'  It  is  important  to  note  that  in  this  practice  match '],[1189.726,'   you  will  NOT  be  paid  for  the  choices  made  '],[1193.078,'  the  payoffs  are  all  listed  as  zero '],[1195.205,'   so  that  you  can  focus  on  getting  comfortable  with  the  interface '],[1198.524,'   rather  than  focusing  on  the  payoffs  '],[1201.835,'  You  are  NOT  paired  with  another  participant  '],[1205.167,'  Your  opponent  for  the  practice  match  is  a  computer  that  is  playing  RANDOMLY  '],[1210.638,'']];
