var links=[[0.015,' Welcome  to  the  Vernon  Smith  Experimental  Economics  Laboratory  '],[5.147,'  Please  carefully  watch  these  video  instructions  and  follow  along  on  the  paper  copy  at  your  desk  '],[12.365,'  Experiment  Overview '],[14.972,'  You  are  about  to  participate  in  an  experiment  in  the  economics  of  decision making  '],[20.657,'  If  you  listen  carefully '],[22.218,'   you  could  earn  a  large  amount  of  money '],[24.235,'   that  will  be  paid  to  you  in  cash '],[26.234,'   in  private '],[27.105,'   at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[29.898,'  It  is  important  that  you  remain  silent  and  do  not  look  at  other  people\'s  work  '],[35.051,'  If  you  have  any  questions '],[36.877,'   or  need  any  assistance  of  any  kind '],[39.229,'   please  raise  your  hand  and  an  experimenter  will  help  you  out  '],[43.490,'  During  the  experiment '],[44.999,'   do  not  talk '],[45.974,'   laugh  or  exclaim  out  loud  and  be  sure  to  keep  your  eyes  on  your  screen  only  '],[51.096,'  In  addition '],[52.081,'   please  turn  off  your  cell  phones '],[53.981,'   etc  '],[55.784,'  and  put  them  away  during  the  experiment  '],[59.036,'  Anybody  that  violates  these  rules  will  be  asked  to  leave  and  will  not  be  paid  '],[64.057,'  We  expect '],[64.826,'   and  appreciate  your  cooperation  '],[68.456,'  Agenda '],[69.749,'  one  '],[71.902,'  We  will  first  go  over  the  instructions  '],[75.384,'  two  '],[77.482,'  Then  we  will  have  a  practice  match  to  learn  the  interface  '],[81.569,'  three  '],[83.798,'  Next '],[84.594,'   there  will  be  a  quiz  with  ten  questions  to  make  sure  everyone  understands  the  instructions  '],[91.630,'  All  ten  questions  will  refer  to  these  instructions  so  you  should  follow  them  carefully  '],[97.335,'  If  you  answer  all  questions  correctly  you  will  earn  ten  dollars  '],[102.846,'  If  you  answer  at  least  one  question  incorrectly  you  will  earn  nothing '],[106.406,'   at  which  point  you  will  not  need  to  answer  any  more  questions  '],[111.789,'  You  will  have  ten  minutes  to  answer  the  ten  questions  '],[115.705,'  four  '],[117.948,'  After  the  quiz '],[119.141,'   you  will  have  ten  minutes  to  prepare  for  the  experiment  '],[123.106,'  In  the  experiment  you  will  be  working  with  a  fictitious  currency  called  Francs  '],[128.471,'  You  will  be  paid  in  US  Dollars  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[132.977,'  The  exchange  rate  today  is '],[135.281,'  one thousand two hundred and fifty  Francs  equals  one  u s dollars  '],[144.625,'  Experiment  Details '],[146.809,'  This  experiment  consists  of  ten  matches  '],[150.476,'  Prior  to  start  of  the  experiment '],[152.571,'   all  participants  may  be  split  into  two  groups  '],[156.504,'  The  groups  will  stay  fixed  and  you  will  know  number  of  participants  in  your  group  throughout  the  experiment  '],[162.641,'  At  the  beginning  of  each  match '],[164.535,'   you  will  be  paired  randomly  with  one  other  participant  from  your  group  '],[169.190,'  You  will  remain  matched  with  this  same  participant  until  the  end  of  the  match '],[172.873,'   but  then  will  be  paired  with  another  randomly  selected  participant  from  your  group  in  the  following  match  '],[179.234,'  Each  match  will  have  the  same  structure '],[181.443,'   but  may  contain  different  numbers  of  periods  '],[185.046,'  You  will  remain  anonymous  throughout  the  experiment  '],[188.631,'  You  will  not  know  the  identity  of  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with '],[192.346,'   and  they  will  not  know  your  identity  '],[195.192,'  The  choices  made  by  you '],[196.867,'   and  the  participant  you  are  paired  with '],[198.892,'   have  no  effect  on  the  payoffs  of  participants  in  other  pairs '],[202.602,'   and  vice  versa  '],[204.712,'  Therefore '],[205.617,'   your  payoff  in  a  given  match  is  based  solely  on  the  choices  made  by  you  and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  '],[212.470,'  Next '],[213.258,'   Let\'s  Look  at  the  experimental  Interface '],[218.164,'  Specific  Instructions  for  Each  Period '],[221.168,'  Your  payoff  in  each  period  will  depend  on  your  choice  and  the  choice  of  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  '],[227.568,'  You  will  choose  one  of  two  options '],[229.549,'   either  W  or  Y  '],[231.972,'  You  will  be  able  to  see  the  payoffs  for  each  combination  of  choices  for  you  and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  '],[238.907,'  These  payoffs  will  remain  the  same  throughout  the  entire  experiment '],[243.068,'   all  matches   '],[245.621,'  The  payoffs  will  be  displayed  in  a  table  like  this '],[248.776,'  In  this  example  above '],[250.270,'   the  rows  are  the  following '],[252.299,'  Row   number one  '],[253.554,' Your  choice '],[255.515,'   either  W  or  Y  in  this  example  '],[258.772,'  Row   number two  '],[260.042,' Other\'s  choice '],[262.215,'   either  W  or  Y  in  this  example  '],[266.473,'  Row   number three  '],[267.718,' Your  payoff  '],[269.684,'  Row   number four  '],[270.951,' Other\'s  payoff  '],[273.138,'  Row   number five  '],[274.503,' Total  number  of  times  that  that  combination  has  been  played  this  match  '],[279.584,'  Examples '],[281.088,'  In  the  table  above '],[282.480,'   if  you  choose  W  and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  chooses  Y '],[286.877,'   then  you  receive  a  payoff  of  three '],[289.011,'   and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  receives  a  payoff  of  four  '],[293.743,'  This  combination  has  occurred  nineteen  times  so  far  this  match  '],[298.586,'  If  you  choose  W  and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  chooses  W '],[303.084,'   then  you  receive  a  payoff  of  seven '],[305.332,'   and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  receives  a  payoff  of  eight  '],[309.901,'  This  combination  has  occurred  six  times  so  far  this  match  '],[314.485,'  If  you  choose  Y  and  the  participant  you  are  paired  with  chooses  Y '],[318.456,'   then  you  receive  a  payoff  of  one '],[320.641,'   and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  receives  a  payoff  of  two  '],[325.320,'  This  combination  has  occurred  six  times  so  far  this  match  '],[330.418,'  History '],[331.775,'  As  the  match  progresses '],[333.370,'   you  will  see  the  history  of  play  across  the  top  of  the  screen '],[336.729,'   displayed  like  this '],[338.549,'  This  history  displays  the  period '],[341.128,'   labeled  Period  '],[342.727,'  your  choice  in  that  period '],[344.854,'   labeled  My  Choice  '],[346.777,'  the  choice  of  the  participant  you  are  paired  with  in  that  period '],[350.319,'   labeled  Other\'s  Choice  '],[352.427,'  and  the  payoff  for  that  period '],[354.696,'   labeled  My  Payoff   '],[357.654,'  For  example '],[358.808,'   in  the  above  history '],[360.258,'   in  period  thirty nine '],[362.041,'   you  played  W '],[363.410,'   the  participant  you  are  paired  with  played  Y '],[366.032,'   and  you  received  a  payoff  of  three  '],[369.822,'  Rules '],[371.036,'  Rather  than  directly  making  choices  of  W  or  Y '],[374.482,'   you  will  develop  a  set  of  rules  which  will  automatically  make  choices  for  you  '],[379.604,'  The  set  of  rules  will  appear  in  the  middle  of  the  screen  '],[383.413,'  You  will  be  able  to  construct  rules  using  the  rule  constructor  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen  '],[389.043,'  A  rule  consists  of  two  parts '],[391.419,'  Input  Sequence  '],[392.714,' A  sequence  of  choices  made  by  you  and  the  participant  you  are  paired  with  '],[397.759,'  Output  '],[398.573,' A  choice  to  be  made  by  you  after  the  input  sequence  occurs  '],[403.205,'  Some  example  rules  are  displayed  below '],[406.061,'  For  example '],[407.217,'   Rule   number two  has  an  input  sequence  of '],[410.391,'   Y '],[411.058,' Y  '],[412.749,'   W '],[413.614,' W  '],[415.352,'   Y '],[416.035,' W  '],[417.261,'  and  an  output  of  W  '],[419.742,'  This  means  that  if  you  have  played  Y '],[421.867,'   W '],[422.670,'   and  then  Y  in  the  last  three  periods '],[424.911,'   and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  has  played  Y '],[428.106,'   W '],[428.845,'   and  then  W '],[430.067,'   this  rule  will  lead  you  to  play  W  in  the  next  period  '],[434.418,'  As  play  progresses  you  will  develop  a  set  of  rules  that  will  be  used  to  make  your  choices  '],[440.271,'  Play  will  proceed  as  follows '],[442.771,'  Each  period '],[443.665,'   your  set  of  rules  will  select  the  choice  to  be  made  next  period  '],[448.002,'  The  rule  that  will  be  used  to  make  the  choice  will  be  highlighted  '],[452.001,'  The  corresponding  sequence  in  the  history  will  be  highlighted  '],[456.318,'  A  preview  of  the  choice  to  be  made  next  period  will  be  shown  as  a  lightly  colored  cell  on  the  history  of  play  '],[463.352,'  In  order  to  move  to  the  next  period '],[465.418,'   you  have  to  confirm  the  choice  by  clicking  on  the  corresponding  history  cell  '],[470.659,'  Once  you  have  confirmed  your  choice '],[472.762,'   the  light  color  will  turn  to  a  regular  color '],[475.463,'   and  you  may  need  to  wait  for  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  to  make  their  choice  '],[485.692,'  There  are  several  ways  that  you  can  modify  your  rules  during  the  experiment  '],[490.782,'  one  '],[492.949,'  First '],[493.672,'   you  can  use  the  rule  constructor  in  the  bottom  center  of  the  screen  '],[498.385,'  Press  the  plus  button  to  add  more  columns '],[500.912,'   or  one  of  the  minus  buttons  to  subtract  columns  '],[504.937,'  Click  on  the  question  marks  to  fill  in  the  boxes  '],[508.780,'  When  you  click  on  a  question  mark '],[510.834,'   either  a  W  or  a  Y  will  appear  '],[514.123,'  If  you  click  on  a  W '],[515.807,'   it  will  switch  to  a  Y '],[517.416,'   and  if  you  click  on  a  Y '],[519.077,'   it  will  switch  to  a  W  '],[521.690,'  Once  you  have  completely  filled  in  the  rule '],[524.427,'   leaving  no  question  marks  '],[526.761,'  the  add  rule  button  will  appear '],[528.897,'   and  the  rule  can  be  added  to  your  set  '],[531.860,'  two  '],[533.961,'  Second '],[534.743,'   if  you  look  at  a  rule  in  the  set '],[536.592,'   you  will  notice  a  green  copy  button '],[538.625,'   and  a  red  delete  button  '],[541.010,'  If  you  press  the  green  copy  button '],[543.054,'   it  will  copy  the  rule  down  to  the  constructor '],[545.585,'   and  you  will  be  able  to  create  a  similar  rule  '],[551.116,'  If  you  press  the  red  delete  button '],[553.011,'   it  will  delete  the  rule  from  the  set  '],[558.153,'  three  '],[560.384,'  Since  your  rule  set  needs  to  make  a  single  choice  each  period '],[563.909,'   it  is  not  possible  to  have  two  rules  with  the  same  input  sequence '],[567.950,'   but  with  different  outputs  '],[570.449,'  If  you  create  a  rule  that  has  the  same  input  sequence  but  a  different  output '],[574.583,'   you  will  get  an  error  that  says  Conflicting  rule  in  set '],[577.648,'   and  a  button  that  says  Switch  Rule  will  appear  '],[581.259,'  If  you  press  this  button '],[582.752,'   it  will  delete  the  conflicting  rule  from  the  rule  set '],[585.494,'   and  add  the  rule  from  the  constructor  '],[590.655,'  The  length  of  the  rule  is  measured  by  the  length  of  the  input  sequence  '],[595.238,'  So  rule   number two '],[596.899,'   and  rule   number three  have  a  length  of  three '],[599.465,'   and  rule   number four  has  a  length  of  two  '],[602.909,'  A  rule  of  length  n  is  said  to  fit  the  history  if  the  input  sequence  matches  the  last  n  periods  of  the  history  '],[610.157,'  For  example '],[611.316,'   since  the  last  three  periods  of  play  in  the  above  history '],[615.060,'   periods  forty two  through  forty four  '],[617.880,'  have  been '],[619.237,'   Y '],[619.904,'   Y  '],[621.595,'   W '],[622.460,'   W  '],[623.695,'  and '],[624.845,'   Y '],[625.529,'   W  '],[626.757,'  and  that  sequence  is  also  the  input  for  rule   number two '],[631.159,'  then  rule   number two  is  said  to  fit  the  history  '],[634.838,'  Similarly '],[635.860,'   given  the  above  history '],[637.437,'   we  can  see  that  rule   number four  fits  the  history '],[641.449,'  but  rule   number three  does  not  fit  the  history  '],[645.206,'  If  more  than  one  rule  fits  the  history '],[647.635,'   then  the  rule  with  the  longer  length  will  determine  the  choice  '],[651.892,'  For  example '],[653.062,'   given  the  above  history  since  both  rule   number two '],[656.118,'   and  rule   number four  fit  the  history '],[658.408,'   rule   number two  will  be  used  to  make  your  choice '],[661.093,'   since  it  is  longer  '],[663.540,'  Therefore '],[664.459,'   given  the  history '],[665.700,'   and  the  rule  set '],[666.835,'   your  choice  next  period  will  be  W '],[669.490,'   as  prescribed  by  rule   number two  '],[674.706,'  If  no  rules  fit  the  history '],[676.628,'   then  your  Default  Rule  will  be  selected  '],[679.998,'  The  default  rule  will  only  be  used  when  no  rules  fit  the  history  '],[684.740,'  To  select  your  default  rule  select  either  W '],[687.585,'   or  Y '],[688.383,'   in  the  bottom  left  of  your  screen  '],[691.302,'  Additionally '],[692.352,'   you  have  to  select  the  First  Period  rule  '],[695.539,'  The  first  period  rule  will  only  be  used  in  the  first  period  of  the  match  '],[700.657,'  To  select  your  first  period  rule  select  either  W '],[703.865,'   or  Y '],[704.663,'   in  the  bottom  left  of  your  screen  '],[708.083,'  Additional  Examples '],[710.161,'  In  the  example  above '],[711.669,'   Rule   number four '],[713.053,'   and  Rule   number nine '],[714.582,'   both  fit  the  history  '],[717.072,'  However '],[717.906,'   rule   number nine  will  be  selected  because  it  is  longer  '],[722.092,'  Therefore '],[723.002,'   W  will  be  played  in  the  next  period '],[725.441,'   as  prescribed  by  rule   number nine  '],[728.757,'  For  the  example  above '],[730.340,'   how  can  we  change  the  rule  set  to  ensure  that  Y  is  played  next  period  '],[735.521,'  There  are  several  ways  to  make  changes  to  the  rule  set  in  order  for  Y  to  be  played  '],[741.161,'  First '],[741.883,'   you  can  delete  Rule   number nine '],[743.978,'   which  would  cause  Rule   number four  to  be  the  longest  rule  that  fits  the  history '],[748.298,'   and  therefore  would  lead  to  Y  being  played  next  period  '],[757.392,'  Second '],[758.173,'   you  can  add  a  longer  rule  that  fits  the  history  that  has  Y  as  the  output  '],[763.282,'  Since  you  added  a  longer  rule  that  fits  the  history '],[766.371,'   that  rule  will  be  used  to  make  the  choice '],[768.770,'   and  will  select  Y  as  the  choice  for  next  period  '],[778.063,'  Number  of  Periods  Per  Match '],[780.491,'  The  number  of  periods  in  each  match  will  be  determined  randomly  using  the  following  procedure  '],[786.388,'  At  the  end  of  each  period '],[788.041,'   a  number  will  be  chosen  randomly  from  the  set  of  numbers   '],[791.577,' one '],[792.337,' two '],[793.038,' three '],[793.829,'   up  to '],[794.705,' forty eight '],[795.735,' forty nine '],[796.967,' fifty '],[797.889,'   where  each  number  is  equally  likely  '],[801.010,'  If  the  number  is  one '],[802.590,'   then  the  match  will  end  '],[804.948,'  If  the  number  is  not  one '],[806.802,'   then  the  match  will  continue  '],[809.456,'  The  number  will  always  be  placed  back  into  the  set  after  it  is  drawn  '],[814.250,'  Thus '],[814.928,'   in  any  period  there  is  a  two  percent  CHANCE  that  the  match  will  end '],[818.724,'   and  a  ninety eight  percent  CHANCE  that  the  match  will  have  another  period  '],[823.499,'  Therefore '],[824.408,'   the  expected  number  of  periods  in  each  match  will  be  fifty  '],[828.919,'  This  procedure  has  been  performed  on  the  computer  before  the  experiment  '],[833.974,'  Therefore '],[834.879,'   you  will  not  see  the  number  selected  from   '],[837.085,' one '],[837.845,' two '],[838.545,' three '],[839.337,'   up  to '],[840.213,' forty eight '],[841.244,' forty nine '],[842.474,' fifty '],[844.336,'  To  ensure  that  the  length  of  the  match  is  not  dependent  on  your  play '],[847.929,'   the  number  of  periods  for  each  match  has  be  written  on  the  board  before  the  experiment '],[852.532,'   and  will  be  uncovered  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[856.225,'  Your  choices  will  be  determined  automatically  from  your  rule  set  '],[860.661,'  However '],[861.495,'   you  will  need  to  confirm  the  choice  within  an  allotted  amount  of  time  '],[865.874,'  To  confirm  your  choice '],[867.462,'   click  on  your  action  for  the  next  period  within  the  history  at  the  top  of  the  screen  '],[872.904,'  If  you  don\'t  confirm  the  choice  within  the  allotted  amount  of  time '],[876.622,'   then  the  choice  will  be  confirmed  automatically  at  the  end  of  the  allotted  time  '],[881.535,'  The  experiment  will  not  be  able  to  proceed  until  everyone  confirms  their  choices  '],[887.193,'  Everyone  in  your  group  will  have  the  same  amount  of  time  allotted  in  each  period  '],[893.112,'  Additional  Information  about  Matches '],[896.010,'  During  matches  one  through  ten  you  will  be  able  to  construct  the  set  of  rules  to  make  your  choices  '],[902.010,'  All  of  the  rules  in  your  set  at  the  end  of  one  match  will  remain  in  your  set  at  the  start  of  the  next  match  '],[908.323,'  Before  the  first  match '],[909.901,'   you  will  have  one  minute  to  look  over  the  payoffs '],[912.408,'   and  an  additional  ten  minute  to  construct  your  rules  '],[916.742,'  Editing  your  set  of  rules '],[918.875,'  In  the  experiment  today  you  will  need  to  pay  a  cost  to  edit  rules  during  the  match  '],[924.303,'  More  specifically '],[925.706,'   Before  each  match  starts '],[927.404,'   you  can  make  changes  to  your  set  of  rules  at  no  cost  '],[931.569,'  After  each  match  starts '],[933.259,'   if  you  want  to  make  changes  to  your  set  of  rules '],[935.998,'   you  must  click  the  Unlock  Rules  button  '],[939.125,'  The  cost  for  clicking  the  Unlock  Rules  button  is  two hundred and fifty  Francs  '],[944.470,'  The  total  cost  incurred  in  all  matches  will  be  displayed  at  the  top  of  the  screen  in  red  '],[950.253,'  You  will  be  able  to  edit  your  rules  for  the  duration  of  one  period  '],[954.914,'  Once  you  are  done  editing  your  rules  you  may  click  the  Lock  Rules  button  '],[959.466,'  If  you  don\'t  want  make  changes  to  your  set  of  rules '],[962.322,'   you  may  choose  not  to  click  the  Unlock  Rule  button  '],[965.903,'  Then  you  will  not  incur  the  cost  of  two hundred and fifty  Francs  '],[970.445,'  In  either  case '],[971.547,'   you  will  need  to  confirm  the  choice  made  within  the  time  limit  set  for  each  period  '],[976.559,'  If  the  time  limit  within  a  period  reached '],[979.070,'   your  rules  will  become  locked '],[980.975,'   your  choice  will  be  confirmed  automatically '],[983.424,'   and  you  will  proceed  to  the  next  period  '],[987.205,'  Starting  Rules '],[988.965,'  Prior  to  the  start  of  the  experiment  you  will  have  ten  minutes  to  construct  your  starting  set  of  rules  '],[995.360,'  During  that  time '],[996.519,'   you  will  be  presented  with  a  split screen  view  of  of  the  construction  screen  '],[1001.432,'  In  this  view '],[1002.498,'   you  will  have  an  opportunity  to  test  what  your  rule  set  will  select  as  an  output  for  a  variety  of  hypothetical  histories  '],[1010.041,'  The  split screen  will  consist  of  two  sides  '],[1013.695,'  The  right  side  is  the  Starting  Rules  side  '],[1017.309,'  Rules  added  to  this  side  will  be  added  to  your  rule  set  at  the  start  of  the  first  match  '],[1022.634,'  The  left  side  is  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side  '],[1026.436,'  Rules  added  to  this  side  can  be  used  to  test  to  see  what  choices  different  combinations  of  rules  will  lead  to  '],[1033.554,'  You  will  be  able  to  move  rules  from  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side  to  the  Starting  Rules  side  by  clicking  the  blue  move  button  '],[1041.106,'  To  delete  rules  from  either  side '],[1043.275,'   you  need  to  click  the  delete  button  '],[1046.078,'  You  will  be  able  to  see  what  choice  your  hypothetical '],[1049.007,'   and  your  starting  rule  sets  select  as  a  choice  for  next  period '],[1052.504,'   for  each  of  the  hypothetical  histories  that  you  construct  '],[1056.741,'  Notice  that  you  will  be  able  to  construct '],[1059.123,'   and  store '],[1059.941,'   multiple  histories  at  the  same  time  '],[1063.335,'  You  can  view  one  of  the  other  hypothetical  histories  by  clicking  the  History   number   button  at  the  top  of  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side  '],[1071.628,'  You  can  add  a  new  hypothetical  history  by  clicking  the  New  button  at  the  top  of  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side  '],[1078.546,'  To  construct  a  hypothetical  history  you  will  need  to  click  on  the  question  marks  in  that  history  '],[1084.848,'  You  don\'t  need  to  fill  out  the  entire  history  to  see  what  choice  your  rule  set  will  make  '],[1090.484,'  Therefore '],[1091.391,'   it  is  useful  to  start  filling  out  the  new  histories  from  the  most  recent  periods  on  the  right  side  '],[1097.735,'  Let\'s  look  at  an  example  '],[1100.434,'  Five  periods  of  hypothetical  History   number four  have  been  filled  in  '],[1105.698,'  The  hypothetical  rule  set  will  play  W  after  this  history  occurs  '],[1110.909,'  The  starting  rule  set  will  play  Y  after  this  history  occurs  '],[1120.655,'  Let\'s  look  at  another  example  '],[1123.597,'  fourteen  periods  of  hypothetical  History   number three  have  been  filled  in  '],[1129.008,'  The  hypothetical  rule  set  will  play  Y  after  this  history  occurs  '],[1134.093,'  The  starting  rule  set  will  play  Y  after  this  history  occurs  '],[1143.838,'  You  will  be  able  to  make  changes  to  your  Hypothetical  Rules '],[1147.244,'   and  your  Starting  Rules '],[1148.796,'   for  the  duration  of  the  ten  minutes  '],[1151.897,'  After  the  ten  minutes  are  up '],[1153.574,'   rules  that  are  on  the  Starting  Rules  side  will  be  your  starting  rules  for  the  experiment  '],[1159.934,'  Payoffs '],[1161.297,'  At  the  end  of  the  experiment '],[1163.199,'   you  will  be  paid  in  cash  '],[1165.811,'  Your  payoff  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  will  be  the  sum  of  the  payoffs  for  each  period  '],[1171.396,'  Reminder '],[1172.311,'   the  exchange  rate  today  is  one thousand two hundred and fifty  Francs  equals  one  dollar  '],[1178.557,'  Practice  Match '],[1180.178,'  Next '],[1180.974,'   there  will  be  a  practice  match  to  make  sure  that  you  are  comfortable  with  the  interface  '],[1186.185,'  It  is  important  to  note  that  in  this  practice  match '],[1189.191,'   you  will  NOT  be  paid  for  the  choices  made  '],[1192.497,'  the  payoffs  are  all  listed  as  zero '],[1194.963,'   so  that  you  can  focus  on  getting  comfortable  with  the  interface '],[1198.352,'   rather  than  focusing  on  the  payoffs  '],[1201.560,'  You  are  NOT  paired  with  another  participant  '],[1204.978,'  Your  opponent  for  the  practice  match  is  a  computer  that  is  playing  RANDOMLY  '],[1210.452,'']];
