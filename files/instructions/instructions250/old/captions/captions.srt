00:00:00,015 --> 00:00:02,214
  Welcome  to   the  Vernon  Smith   Experimental  Economics 

2
00:00:02,214 --> 00:00:06,308
  Laboratory.  Please  carefully  watch  these  video 

3
00:00:06,308 --> 00:00:09,210
 instructions  and  follow  along  on  the  paper  copy 

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,305
 at  your  desk.   Experiment  Overview  You  are  about 

5
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:17,803
 to  participate  in  an   experiment  in  the  economics 

6
00:00:17,803 --> 00:00:21,447
 of  decision-making.  If  you  listen  carefully, 

7
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:24,235
  you  could  earn  a  large  amount  of  money,  that 

8
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:27,105
 will  be  paid  to  you  in  cash,  in  private,  at 

9
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:30,276
 the  end  of  the  experiment.  It  is  important 

10
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:32,730
  that  you  remain  silent  and  do  not  look  at 

11
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,216
 other  people's  work.  If  you  have  any  questions, 

12
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:39,229
 or  need  any  assistance  of  any  kind,   please 

13
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:41,687
 raise  your  hand  and  an  experimenter  will  help 

14
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:45,524
 you  out.   During  the  experiment,   do  not  talk, 

15
00:00:45,524 --> 00:00:48,152
 laugh  or  exclaim  out  loud  and  be  sure  to   keep 

16
00:00:48,152 --> 00:00:51,290
 your  eyes  on  your  screen  only.  In  addition, 

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,784
  please  turn  off  your  cell  phones,  etc.  and 

18
00:00:55,784 --> 00:00:59,036
 put  them  away  during  the  experiment.  Anybody 

19
00:00:59,036 --> 00:01:01,529
 that  violates  these  rules  will  be  asked  to 

20
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:04,826
 leave  and  will  not  be  paid.   We  expect,  and 

21
00:01:04,826 --> 00:01:12,129
 appreciate  your  cooperation.   Agenda   1.  We  will 

22
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:17,688
 first  go  over  the  instructions.   2.  Then  we 

23
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:19,747
 will  have  a  practice  match  to  learn  the  interface. 

24
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:26,136
  3.  Next,  there  will  be  a  quiz  with  10  questions 

25
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:28,780
 to  make  sure  everyone  understands  the  instructions. 

26
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,562
  All  10  questions  will  refer  to  these  instructions 

27
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:37,543
 so  you  should  follow  them  carefully.   If  you 

28
00:01:37,543 --> 00:01:39,828
 answer  all  questions  correctly  you  will  earn 

29
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:44,170
 10  dollars.   If  you  answer  at  least  one  question 

30
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,619
 incorrectly  you  will  earn  nothing,  at  which 

31
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,958
 point  you  will  not  need  to  answer  any  more 

32
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:53,246
 questions.   You  will  have  10  minutes  to  answer 

33
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:59,325
 the  10  questions.   4.  After  the  quiz,  you  will 

34
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:01,170
 have  10  minutes  to  prepare  for  the  experiment. 

35
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,291
  In  the  experiment  you  will  be  working  with 

36
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,666
 a  fictitious  currency  called  Francs.  You  will 

37
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,007
 be  paid  in  US  Dollars  at  the  end  of  the  experiment. 

38
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:17,435
  The  exchange  rate  today  is:  1250  Francs  equals 

39
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:27,924
 1  USD.   Experiment  Details   This  experiment  consists 

40
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:31,621
 of  ten  matches.   Prior  to  start  of  the  experiment, 

41
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:35,084
 all  participants  may  be  split  into  two  groups. 

42
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:38,023
 The  groups  will  stay  fixed  and  you  will  know 

43
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:40,113
 number  of  participants  in  your  group  throughout 

44
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:44,131
 the  experiment.   At  the  beginning  of  each  match, 

45
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,264
 you  will  be  paired  randomly  with  one  other 

46
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:49,556
 participant  from  your  group.  You  will  remain 

47
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:51,753
 matched  with  this  same  participant  until  the 

48
00:02:51,753 --> 00:02:53,612
 end  of  the  match,  but  then  will  be  paired 

49
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:56,385
 with  another  randomly  selected  participant  from 

50
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,486
 your  group  in  the  following  match.  Each  match 

51
00:02:59,486 --> 00:03:01,813
 will  have  the  same  structure,   but  may  contain 

52
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:05,364
 different  numbers  of  periods.   You  will  remain 

53
00:03:05,364 --> 00:03:08,807
 anonymous  throughout  the  experiment.  You  will 

54
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:11,274
 not  know  the  identity  of  the  participant  that 

55
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,008
 you  are  paired  with,  and  they  will  not  know 

56
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:16,867
 your  identity.   The  choices  made  by  you,  and 

57
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:19,100
 the  participant  you  are  paired  with,  have  no 

58
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,797
 effect  on  the  payoffs  of  participants  in  other 

59
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:25,806
 pairs,  and  vice  versa.  Therefore,  your  payoff 

60
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,259
 in  a  given  match  is  based  solely  on  the  choices 

61
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:30,713
 made  by  you  and  the  participant  that  you  are 

62
00:03:30,713 --> 00:03:33,997
 paired  with.   Next,  Let's  Look  at  the  experimental 

63
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:39,850
 Interface  Specific  Instructions  for  Each  Period 

64
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,402
 Your  payoff  in  each  period  will  depend  on  your 

65
00:03:43,402 --> 00:03:45,450
 choice  and  the  choice  of  the  participant  that 

66
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,463
 you  are  paired  with.  You  will  choose  one  of 

67
00:03:48,463 --> 00:03:52,509
 two  options,  either  W  or  Y.  You  will  be  able 

68
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:54,837
 to  see  the  payoffs  for  each  combination  of 

69
00:03:54,837 --> 00:03:56,987
 choices  for  you  and  the  participant  that  you 

70
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,065
 are  paired  with.  These  payoffs  will  remain  the 

71
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:03,354
 same  throughout  the  entire  experiment  (all  matches). 

72
00:04:03,354 --> 00:04:07,708
  The  payoffs  will  be  displayed  in  a  table  like 

73
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,845
 this:  In  this  example  above,  the  rows  are  the 

74
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:16,380
 following:   Row  #1  - Your  choice  (either  W  or 

75
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,698
 Y  in  this  example)   Row  #2  - Other's  choice 

76
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:27,524
 (either  W  or  Y  in  this  example)   Row  #3  - Your 

77
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:34,301
 payoff.   Row  #4  - Other's  payoff.   Row  #5  - Total 

78
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:37,480
 number  of  times  that  that  combination  has  been 

79
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,896
 played  this  match.  Examples:  In  the  table  above, 

80
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:44,996
  if  you  choose  W  and   the  participant  that 

81
00:04:44,996 --> 00:04:47,309
 you  are  paired  with  chooses  Y,  then   you  receive 

82
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:50,387
 a  payoff  of  3,  and   the  participant  that  you 

83
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:53,743
 are  paired  with  receives  a  payoff  of  4.   This 

84
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:56,909
 combination  has  occurred  19  times  so  far  this 

85
00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:00,150
 match.   If  you  choose  W  and   the  participant 

86
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,290
 that  you  are  paired  with  chooses  W,  then   you 

87
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,708
 receive  a  payoff  of  7,  and   the  participant 

88
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,964
 that  you  are  paired  with  receives  a  payoff 

89
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:12,084
 of  8.   This  combination  has  occurred  6  times 

90
00:05:12,084 --> 00:05:15,593
 so  far  this  match.   If  you  choose  Y  and   the 

91
00:05:15,593 --> 00:05:18,456
 participant  you  are  paired  with  chooses  Y,  then 

92
00:05:18,456 --> 00:05:21,029
  you  receive  a  payoff  of  1,  and   the  participant 

93
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,357
 that  you  are  paired  with  receives  a  payoff 

94
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:27,503
 of  2.   This  combination  has  occurred  6  times 

95
00:05:27,503 --> 00:05:32,477
 so  far  this  match.   History  As  the  match  progresses, 

96
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:35,542
 you  will  see  the  history  of  play  across  the 

97
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:38,549
 top  of  the  screen,  displayed  like  this:   This 

98
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:41,494
 history  displays   the  period  (labeled  Period), 

99
00:05:41,494 --> 00:05:45,773
  your  choice  in  that  period  (labeled  My  Choice), 

100
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:48,459
  the  choice  of  the  participant  you  are  paired 

101
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:51,457
 with  in  that  period  (labeled  Other's  Choice), 

102
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:55,192
 and   the  payoff  for  that  period  (labeled  My 

103
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:59,522
 Payoff).  For  example,  in  the  above  history, 

104
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:03,632
  in  period  39,   you  played  W,   the  participant 

105
00:06:03,632 --> 00:06:06,454
 you  are  paired  with  played  Y,   and  you  received 

106
00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:11,647
 a  payoff  of  3.   Rules  Rather  than  directly 

107
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:14,857
 making  choices  of  W  or  Y,  you  will  develop 

108
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:17,482
 a  set  of  rules  which  will  automatically  make 

109
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:20,544
 choices  for  you.   The  set  of  rules  will  appear 

110
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:23,800
 in  the  middle  of  the  screen.   You  will  be 

111
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,927
 able  to  construct  rules  using  the  rule  constructor 

112
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,525
 at  the  bottom  of  the  screen.   A  rule  consists 

113
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:33,323
 of  two  parts:   Input  Sequence  - A  sequence  of 

114
00:06:33,323 --> 00:06:35,759
 choices  made  by  you  and  the  participant  you 

115
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,432
 are  paired  with.   Output  - A  choice  to  be  made 

116
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:43,205
 by  you  after  the  input  sequence  occurs.   Some 

117
00:06:43,205 --> 00:06:46,308
 example  rules  are  displayed  below:   For  example, 

118
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:52,749
 Rule  #2  has  an  input  sequence  of   (Y,Y),   (W,W), 

119
00:06:52,749 --> 00:07:00,224
  (Y,W)  and  an  output  of   W.  This  means  that 

120
00:07:00,224 --> 00:07:03,490
 if  you  have  played   Y,  W,  and  then  Y  in  the 

121
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,193
 last  three  periods,  and  the  participant  that 

122
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,845
 you  are  paired  with  has  played   Y,  W,  and 

123
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,453
 then  W,  this  rule  will  lead  you  to  play   W 

124
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:15,426
 in  the  next  period.  As  play  progresses  you 

125
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:17,844
 will  develop  a  set  of  rules  that  will  be  used 

126
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:21,306
 to  make  your  choices.  Play  will  proceed  as 

127
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:24,452
 follows:  Each  period,   your  set  of  rules  will 

128
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:28,002
 select  the  choice  to  be  made  next  period.  The 

129
00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:29,688
  rule  that  will  be  used  to  make  the  choice 

130
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:32,918
 will  be  highlighted.  The  corresponding   sequence 

131
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:36,513
 in  the  history  will  be  highlighted.  A   preview 

132
00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:38,856
 of  the  choice  to  be  made  next  period  will 

133
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:41,003
 be  shown  as  a  lightly  colored  cell  on  the 

134
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:44,548
 history  of  play.  In  order  to  move  to  the  next 

135
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,033
 period,  you  have  to  confirm  the  choice  by  clicking 

136
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:50,933
 on  the  corresponding  history  cell.   Once  you 

137
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:53,150
 have  confirmed  your  choice,  the  light  color 

138
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,848
 will  turn  to  a  regular  color,  and  you  may 

139
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:58,155
 need  to  wait  for  the  participant  that  you  are 

140
00:07:58,155 --> 00:08:05,887
 paired  with  to  make  their  choice.   There  are 

141
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,033
 several  ways  that  you  can  modify  your  rules 

142
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:14,085
 during  the  experiment.  1.   First,  you  can  use 

143
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:16,561
 the  rule  constructor  in  the  bottom  center  of 

144
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:20,026
 the  screen.   Press  the  plus  button  to  add  more 

145
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:22,864
 columns,   or  one  of  the  minus  buttons  to  subtract 

146
00:08:22,864 --> 00:08:26,470
 columns.  Click  on  the  question  marks  to  fill 

147
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,945
 in  the  boxes.  When  you  click  on  a  question 

148
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:34,123
 mark,   either  a  W  or  a  Y  will  appear.  If 

149
00:08:34,123 --> 00:08:36,990
 you  click  on  a  W,   it  will  switch  to  a  Y, 

150
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,487
 and  if  you  click  on  a  Y,   it  will  switch 

151
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:43,129
 to  a  W.   Once  you  have  completely  filled  in 

152
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:47,005
 the  rule  (leaving  no  question  marks),   the  add 

153
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:49,421
 rule  button  will  appear,   and  the  rule  can 

154
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:55,112
 be  added  to  your  set.  2.  Second,  if  you  look 

155
00:08:55,112 --> 00:08:57,333
 at  a  rule  in  the  set,   you  will  notice  a 

156
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,476
 green  copy  button,   and  a  red  delete  button. 

157
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:03,250
 If  you   press  the  green  copy  button,  it  will 

158
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,585
 copy  the  rule  down  to  the  constructor,   and 

159
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:07,752
 you  will  be  able  to  create  a  similar  rule. 

160
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:13,226
 If  you   press  the  red  delete  button,  it  will 

161
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:20,606
 delete  the  rule  from  the   set.  3.  Since  your 

162
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:22,827
 rule  set  needs  to  make  a  single  choice  each 

163
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:25,940
 period,  it  is  not  possible  to  have  two  rules 

164
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,322
 with  the  same  input  sequence,  but  with  different 

165
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:31,953
 outputs.   If  you  create  a  rule  that  has  the 

166
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:34,021
 same  input  sequence  but  a  different  output, 

167
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:36,222
 you  will  get  an  error  that   says  'Conflicting 

168
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:38,970
 rule  in  set",  and  a   button  that  says  'Switch 

169
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,134
 Rule"  will  appear.  If  you  press  this  button, 

170
00:09:42,134 --> 00:09:44,716
 it  will  delete  the   conflicting  rule  from  the 

171
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:46,807
 rule  set,   and  add  the  rule  from  the   constructor. 

172
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:52,450
 The  length  of  the  rule  is  measured  by  the 

173
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,825
 length  of  the  input  sequence.  So   rule  #2, 

174
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:59,692
 and   rule  #3  have  a  length  of  3,  and   rule 

175
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:03,664
 #4  has  a  length  of  2.  A  rule  of  length  n 

176
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:06,119
 is  said  to  fit  the  history  if  the  input  sequence 

177
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:08,385
 matches  the  last  n  periods  of  the  history. 

178
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:12,645
 For  example,  since  the  last  three  periods  of 

179
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:16,330
 play  in  the  above  history   (periods  42  through 

180
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:25,529
 44)  have  been   (Y,  Y),   (W,  W),  and   (Y,  W), 

181
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:29,107
 and  that  sequence  is  also  the  input  for   rule 

182
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:33,067
 #2,  then  rule  #2  is  said  to  fit  the  history. 

183
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:37,872
 Similarly,  given  the  above  history,  we  can  see 

184
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:41,877
 that   rule  #4  fits  the  history,  but   rule  #3 

185
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:45,877
 does  not  fit  the  history.  If  more  than  one 

186
00:10:45,877 --> 00:10:48,506
 rule  fits  the  history,  then  the  rule  with  the 

187
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:51,892
 longer  length  will  determine  the  choice.  For 

188
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:54,902
 example,  given  the  above  history  since  both 

189
00:10:54,902 --> 00:10:58,408
  rule  #2,  and   rule  #4  fit  the  history,   rule 

190
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,093
 #2  will  be  used  to  make  your  choice,  since 

191
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,991
 it  is  longer.  Therefore,  given  the  history, 

192
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:08,181
 and  the  rule  set,  your  choice  next  period  will 

193
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:15,142
  be  W,  as  prescribed  by   rule  #2.   If  no  rules 

194
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,718
 fit  the  history,  then  your   Default  Rule  will 

195
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:21,454
 be  selected.  The  default  rule  will  only  be 

196
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:24,930
 used  when  no  rules  fit  the  history.   To  select 

197
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,910
 your  default  rule  select  either   W,  or   Y, 

198
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,302
 in  the  bottom  left  of  your  screen.  Additionally, 

199
00:11:31,302 --> 00:11:34,173
 you  have  to  select  the   First  Period  rule. 

200
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:37,690
 The  first  period  rule  will  only  be  used  in 

201
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,224
 the  first  period  of  the  match.  To  select  your 

202
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:44,183
 first  period  rule  select  either   W,  or   Y, 

203
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:48,083
 in  the  bottom  left  of  your  screen.   Additional 

204
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:53,053
 Examples  In  the  example  above,   Rule  #4,  and 

205
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:57,906
  Rule  #9,  both  fit  the  history.  However,  rule 

206
00:11:57,906 --> 00:12:02,092
 #9  will  be  selected  because  it  is  longer.  Therefore, 

207
00:12:02,092 --> 00:12:05,441
  W  will  be  played  in  the  next  period,   as 

208
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:09,747
 prescribed  by  rule  #9.  For  the  example  above, 

209
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:12,562
 how  can  we  change  the  rule  set  to  ensure  that 

210
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:15,944
 Y  is  played  next  period.  There  are  several 

211
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,483
 ways  to  make  changes  to  the  rule  set  in  order 

212
00:12:18,483 --> 00:12:22,361
 for  Y  to  be  played.  First,  you  can  delete 

213
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:25,723
  Rule  #9,  which  would  cause   Rule  #4  to  be 

214
00:12:25,723 --> 00:12:28,298
 the  longest  rule  that  fits  the  history,   and 

215
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:30,375
 therefore  would  lead  to  Y  being  played  next 

216
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:39,348
 period.   Second,  you   can  add  a  longer  rule 

217
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:41,699
 that  fits  the  history  that  has  Y  as  the  output. 

218
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:45,363
 Since  you  added  a  longer  rule  that  fits  the 

219
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:48,098
 history,  that  rule  will  be  used  to  make  the 

220
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:50,375
 choice,  and  will  select  Y  as  the  choice  for 

221
00:12:50,375 --> 00:13:00,491
 next  period.   Number  of  Periods  Per  Match  The 

222
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:02,579
 number  of  periods  in  each  match  will  be  determined 

223
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:06,571
 randomly  using  the  following  procedure.  At  the 

224
00:13:06,571 --> 00:13:09,085
 end  of  each  period,   a  number  will  be  chosen 

225
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:13,829
 randomly  from  the  set  of  numbers   {1,2,3,  up 

226
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:19,433
 to,48,49,50},  where  each  number  is  equally  likely. 

227
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:23,528
  If  the  number  is  1,  then  the  match  will  end. 

228
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:27,433
  If  the  number  is  not  1,  then  the  match  will 

229
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:31,062
 continue.  The  number  will  always  be  placed  back 

230
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:35,128
 into  the  set  after  it  is  drawn.  Thus,  in  any 

231
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:37,734
 period  there  is  a  2  percent  CHANCE  that  the 

232
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,235
 match  will  end,  and  a  98  percent  CHANCE  that 

233
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:43,499
 the  match  will  have  another  period.  Therefore, 

234
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:46,754
  the  expected  number  of  periods  in  each  match 

235
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:50,079
 will  be  50.   This  procedure  has  been  performed 

236
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,974
 on  the  computer  before  the  experiment.  Therefore, 

237
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:56,887
 you  will  not  see  the  number  selected  from  {1,2,3, 

238
00:13:56,887 --> 00:14:05,543
 up  to,48,49,50}.  To  ensure  that  the  length  of 

239
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:07,929
 the  match  is  not  dependent  on  your  play,  the 

240
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:10,130
 number  of  periods  for  each  match  has  be  written 

241
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,699
 on  the  board  before  the  experiment,  and  will 

242
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:14,368
 be  uncovered  at  the  end  of  the  experiment. 

243
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:17,744
  Your  choices  will  be  determined   automatically 

244
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:21,848
 from  your  rule  set.  However,  you  will  need 

245
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:23,964
 to  confirm  the  choice  within  an  allotted  amount 

246
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:27,647
 of  time.  To  confirm  your  choice,   click  on 

247
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:29,870
 your  action  for  the  next  period  within  the 

248
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,321
 history  at  the  top  of  the  screen.  If  you  don't 

249
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,616
 confirm  the  choice  within  the  allotted  amount 

250
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:37,508
 of  time,   then  the  choice  will  be  confirmed 

251
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:40,167
 automatically  at  the  end  of  the  allotted  time. 

252
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:43,667
 The  experiment  will  not  be  able  to  proceed 

253
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:47,193
 until  everyone  confirms  their  choices.   Everyone 

254
00:14:47,193 --> 00:14:49,502
 in  your  group  will  have  the  same  amount  of 

255
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:53,839
 time  allotted  in  each  period.   Additional  Information 

256
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,409
 about  Matches  During  matches  1  through  10  you 

257
00:14:57,409 --> 00:14:59,607
 will  be  able  to  construct  the  set  of  rules 

258
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,796
 to  make  your  choices.   All  of  the  rules  in 

259
00:15:02,796 --> 00:15:04,759
 your  set  at  the  end  of  one  match  will  remain 

260
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,920
 in  your  set  at  the  start  of  the  next  match. 

261
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,614
  Before  the  first  match,   you  will  have  1  minute 

262
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:12,787
 to  look  over  the  payoffs,   and  an  additional 

263
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:16,742
 10  minute  to  construct  your  rules.   Editing 

264
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:20,345
 your  set  of  rules  In  the  experiment  today  you 

265
00:15:20,345 --> 00:15:22,367
 will  need  to  pay  a  cost  to  edit  rules  during 

266
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:26,613
 the  match.  More  specifically,  Before  each  match 

267
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:29,240
 starts,  you  can  make  changes  to  your  set  of 

268
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,771
 rules  at  no  cost.  After  each  match  starts, 

269
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:35,383
 if  you  want  to  make  changes  to  your  set  of 

270
00:15:35,383 --> 00:15:37,501
 rules,   you  must  click  the  'Unlock  Rules"  button. 

271
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:41,091
 The  cost  for  clicking  the  'Unlock  Rules"  button 

272
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:45,936
 is  250  Francs.  The  total  cost  incurred  in  all 

273
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:48,239
 matches   will  be  displayed  at  the  top  of  the 

274
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,640
 screen  in  red.  You  will  be  able  to  edit  your 

275
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,914
 rules  for  the  duration  of  one  period.  Once 

276
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:57,093
 you  are  done  editing  your  rules  you  may  click 

277
00:15:57,093 --> 00:16:00,133
 the  'Lock  Rules"   button.  If  you  don't  want 

278
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:02,522
 make  changes  to  your  set  of  rules,  you  may 

279
00:16:02,522 --> 00:16:04,319
 choose  not  to  click  the  'Unlock  Rule"  button. 

280
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:09,048
 Then  you  will  not  incur  the  cost  of  250  Francs. 

281
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:12,639
 In  either  case,  you  will  need  to  confirm  the 

282
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,642
 choice  made  within  the  time  limit  set  for  each 

283
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:18,687
 period.  If  the  time  limit  within  a  period  reached, 

284
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,386
 your  rules  will  become  locked,  your  choice  will 

285
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:23,995
 be  confirmed  automatically,  and  you  will  proceed 

286
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:29,365
 to  the  next  period.   Starting  Rules  Prior  to 

287
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:31,764
 the  start  of  the  experiment  you  will  have  10 

288
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:33,963
 minutes  to  construct  your  starting  set  of  rules. 

289
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:37,768
 During  that  time,  you  will  be  presented  with 

290
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:40,057
 a  split-screen  view  of  of  the  construction  screen. 

291
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:43,184
 In  this  view,  you  will  have  an  opportunity 

292
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:45,586
 to  test  what  your  rule  set  will  select  as 

293
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:48,330
 an  output  for  a  variety  of  hypothetical  histories. 

294
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,224
 The  split-screen  will  consist  of  two  sides. 

295
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:55,848
  The  right  side  is  the  Starting  Rules  side. 

296
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,279
 Rules  added  to  this  side  will  be  added  to 

297
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,248
 your  rule  set  at  the  start  of  the  first  match. 

298
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:05,028
  The  left  side  is  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side. 

299
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:08,556
 Rules  added  to  this  side  can  be  used  to  test 

300
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:11,313
 to  see  what  choices  different  combinations  of 

301
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:14,783
 rules  will  lead  to.  You  will  be  able  to  move 

302
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,241
 rules  from  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side  to  the 

303
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:19,289
 Starting  Rules  side   by  clicking  the  blue  move 

304
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:23,275
 button.  To  delete  rules  from  either  side,   you 

305
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,444
 need  to  click  the  delete  button.  You  will  be 

306
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:27,906
 able  to  see  what  choice   your  hypothetical, 

307
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:31,066
 and   your  starting  rule  sets  select  as  a  choice 

308
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:33,266
 for  next  period,  for  each  of  the  hypothetical 

309
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:37,341
 histories  that  you  construct.  Notice  that  you 

310
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:39,941
 will  be  able  to  construct,  and  store,  multiple 

311
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:43,882
 histories   at  the  same  time.  You  can  view  one 

312
00:17:43,882 --> 00:17:46,433
 of  the  other  hypothetical  histories  by  clicking 

313
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,167
 the   History  #  button  at  the  top  of  the  Hypothetical 

314
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:52,516
 Rules  side.  You  can  add  a  new  hypothetical 

315
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:55,358
 history  by  clicking  the   New  button  at  the 

316
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:58,735
 top  of  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side.  To  construct 

317
00:17:58,735 --> 00:18:01,575
 a  hypothetical  history  you  will  need  to  click 

318
00:18:01,575 --> 00:18:04,848
 on  the   question  marks  in  that  history.  You 

319
00:18:04,848 --> 00:18:07,472
 don't  need  to  fill  out  the  entire  history  to 

320
00:18:07,472 --> 00:18:10,484
 see  what  choice  your  rule  set  will  make.  Therefore, 

321
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:13,375
 it  is  useful  to  start  filling  out  the  new 

322
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,954
 histories  from  the  most  recent  periods  on  the 

323
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:20,434
 right  side.  Let's  look  at  an  example.   Five 

324
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:23,898
 periods  of  hypothetical  History  #4  have  been 

325
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:27,421
 filled  in.   The  hypothetical  rule  set  will  play 

326
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:31,577
 W  after  this  history  occurs.   The  starting  rule 

327
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,026
 set  will  play  Y  after  this  history  occurs. 

328
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:43,999
  Let's  look  at  another  example.   14  periods 

329
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:47,420
 of  hypothetical  History  #3  have  been  filled 

330
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,058
 in.   The  hypothetical  rule  set  will  play  Y 

331
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:54,761
 after  this  history  occurs.   The  starting  rule 

332
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:57,209
 set  will  play  Y  after  this  history  occurs. 

333
00:18:57,209 --> 00:19:05,929
 You  will  be  able  to  make  changes  to  your  Hypothetical 

334
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:09,178
 Rules,  and  your  Starting  Rules,  for  the  duration 

335
00:19:09,178 --> 00:19:13,016
 of  the  10  minutes.  After  the  ten  minutes  are 

336
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:15,349
 up,  rules  that  are  on  the  Starting  Rules  side 

337
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:17,346
 will  be  your  starting  rules  for  the  experiment. 

338
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:23,199
  Payoffs   At  the  end  of  the  experiment,  you 

339
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:26,516
 will  be  paid  in  cash.   Your  payoff  at  the 

340
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:28,806
 end  of  the  experiment  will  be  the  sum  of  the 

341
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:32,518
 payoffs  for  each  period.   Reminder,  the  exchange 

342
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:36,456
 rate  today  is  1250  Francs  equals  1  dollar. 

343
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:41,706
  Practice  Match  Next,  there  will  be  a  practice 

344
00:19:41,706 --> 00:19:43,354
 match  to  make  sure  that  you  are  comfortable 

345
00:19:43,354 --> 00:19:47,484
 with  the  interface.  It  is  important  to  note 

346
00:19:47,484 --> 00:19:49,615
 that  in  this  practice  match,   you  will  NOT 

347
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:52,725
 be  paid  for  the  choices  made.   the  payoffs 

348
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,673
 are  all  listed  as  0,  so  that  you  can  focus 

349
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:58,352
 on  getting  comfortable  with  the  interface,  rather 

350
00:19:58,352 --> 00:20:01,932
 than  focusing  on  the  payoffs.   You  are  NOT 

351
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:05,239
 paired  with  another  participant.  Your  opponent 

352
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:08,888
 for  the  practice  match  is  a  computer  that  is
