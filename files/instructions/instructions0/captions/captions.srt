00:00:00,015 --> 00:00:02,214
  Welcome  to   the  Vernon  Smith   Experimental  Economics 

2
00:00:02,214 --> 00:00:06,308
  Laboratory.  Please  carefully  watch  these  video 

3
00:00:06,308 --> 00:00:09,210
 instructions  and  follow  along  on  the  paper  copy 

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,305
 at  your  desk.   Experiment  Overview  You  are  about 

5
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:17,803
 to  participate  in  an   experiment  in  the  economics 

6
00:00:17,803 --> 00:00:21,447
 of  decision-making.  If  you  listen  carefully, 

7
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:24,235
  you  could  earn  a  large  amount  of  money,  that 

8
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:27,105
 will  be  paid  to  you  in  cash,  in  private,  at 

9
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:30,276
 the  end  of  the  experiment.  It  is  important 

10
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:32,730
  that  you  remain  silent  and  do  not  look  at 

11
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,216
 other  people's  work.  If  you  have  any  questions, 

12
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:39,229
 or  need  any  assistance  of  any  kind,   please 

13
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:41,687
 raise  your  hand  and  an  experimenter  will  help 

14
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:45,524
 you  out.   During  the  experiment,   do  not  talk, 

15
00:00:45,524 --> 00:00:48,152
 laugh  or  exclaim  out  loud  and  be  sure  to   keep 

16
00:00:48,152 --> 00:00:51,290
 your  eyes  on  your  screen  only.  In  addition, 

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,784
  please  turn  off  your  cell  phones,  etc.  and 

18
00:00:55,784 --> 00:00:59,036
 put  them  away  during  the  experiment.  Anybody 

19
00:00:59,036 --> 00:01:01,529
 that  violates  these  rules  will  be  asked  to 

20
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:04,826
 leave  and  will  not  be  paid.   We  expect,  and 

21
00:01:04,826 --> 00:01:12,129
 appreciate  your  cooperation.   Agenda   1.  We  will 

22
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:17,688
 first  go  over  the  instructions.   2.  Then  we 

23
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:19,747
 will  have  a  practice  match  to  learn  the  interface. 

24
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:26,136
  3.  Next,  there  will  be  a  quiz  with  10  questions 

25
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:28,780
 to  make  sure  everyone  understands  the  instructions. 

26
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,562
  All  10  questions  will  refer  to  these  instructions 

27
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:37,543
 so  you  should  follow  them  carefully.   If  you 

28
00:01:37,543 --> 00:01:39,828
 answer  all  questions  correctly  you  will  earn 

29
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:44,170
 10  dollars.   If  you  answer  at  least  one  question 

30
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,619
 incorrectly  you  will  earn  nothing,  at  which 

31
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,958
 point  you  will  not  need  to  answer  any  more 

32
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:53,246
 questions.   You  will  have  10  minutes  to  answer 

33
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:59,325
 the  10  questions.   4.  After  the  quiz,  you  will 

34
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:01,170
 have  10  minutes  to  prepare  for  the  experiment. 

35
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,291
  In  the  experiment  you  will  be  working  with 

36
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,666
 a  fictitious  currency  called  Francs.  You  will 

37
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,007
 be  paid  in  US  Dollars  at  the  end  of  the  experiment. 

38
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:17,435
  The  exchange  rate  today  is:  1250  Francs  equals 

39
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:27,924
 1  USD.   Experiment  Details   This  experiment  consists 

40
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:31,621
 of  ten  matches.   Prior  to  start  of  the  experiment, 

41
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:35,084
 all  participants  may  be  split  into  two  groups. 

42
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:37,998
 The  groups  will  stay  fixed  and  you  will  know 

43
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:40,240
 the  number  of  participants  in  your  group  throughout 

44
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,235
 the  experiment.   At  the  beginning  of  each  match, 

45
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:46,368
 you  will  be  paired  randomly  with  one  other 

46
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:49,662
 participant  from  your  group.  You  will  remain 

47
00:02:49,662 --> 00:02:51,857
 matched  with  this  same  participant  until  the 

48
00:02:51,857 --> 00:02:53,717
 end  of  the  match,  but  then  will  be  paired 

49
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:56,490
 with  another  randomly  selected  participant  from 

50
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,591
 your  group  in  the  following  match.  Each  match 

51
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:01,917
 will  have  the  same  structure,   but  may  contain 

52
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:05,469
 different  numbers  of  periods.   You  will  remain 

53
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:08,911
 anonymous  throughout  the  experiment.  You  will 

54
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:11,379
 not  know  the  identity  of  the  participant  that 

55
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,113
 you  are  paired  with,  and  they  will  not  know 

56
00:03:13,113 --> 00:03:16,971
 your  identity.   The  choices  made  by  you,  and 

57
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:19,204
 the  participant  you  are  paired  with,  have  no 

58
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:21,904
 effect  on  the  payoffs  of  participants  in  other 

59
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:25,911
 pairs,  and  vice  versa.  Therefore,  your  payoff 

60
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:28,364
 in  a  given  match  is  based  solely  on  the  choices 

61
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:30,818
 made  by  you  and  the  participant  that  you  are 

62
00:03:30,818 --> 00:03:34,101
 paired  with.   Next,  Let's  Look  at  the  experimental 

63
00:03:34,101 --> 00:03:39,955
 Interface  Specific  Instructions  for  Each  Period 

64
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:43,511
 Your  payoff  in  each  period  will  depend  on  your 

65
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:45,563
 choice  and  the  choice  of  the  participant  that 

66
00:03:45,563 --> 00:03:48,569
 you  are  paired  with.  You  will  choose  one  of 

67
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:52,613
 two  options,  either  W  or  Y.  You  will  be  able 

68
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:54,942
 to  see  the  payoffs  for  each  combination  of 

69
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:57,091
 choices  for  you  and  the  participant  that  you 

70
00:03:57,091 --> 00:04:00,165
 are  paired  with.  These  payoffs  will  remain  the 

71
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:03,459
 same  throughout  the  entire  experiment  (all  matches). 

72
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:07,811
  The  payoffs  will  be  displayed  in  a  table  like 

73
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:10,948
 this:  In  this  example  above,  the  rows  are  the 

74
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:16,484
 following:   Row  #1  - Your  choice  (either  W  or 

75
00:04:16,484 --> 00:04:20,804
 Y  in  this  example)   Row  #2  - Other's  choice 

76
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:27,629
 (either  W  or  Y  in  this  example)   Row  #3  - Your 

77
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:34,408
 payoff.   Row  #4  - Other's  payoff.   Row  #5  - Total 

78
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:37,585
 number  of  times  that  that  combination  has  been 

79
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:42,006
 played  this  match.  Examples:  In  the  table  above, 

80
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:45,098
  if  you  choose  W  and   the  participant  that 

81
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:47,413
 you  are  paired  with  chooses  Y,  then   you  receive 

82
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:50,494
 a  payoff  of  3,  and   the  participant  that  you 

83
00:04:50,494 --> 00:04:53,847
 are  paired  with  receives  a  payoff  of  4.   This 

84
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:57,016
 combination  has  occurred  19  times  so  far  this 

85
00:04:57,016 --> 00:05:00,253
 match.   If  you  choose  W  and   the  participant 

86
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:03,394
 that  you  are  paired  with  chooses  W,  then   you 

87
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:05,812
 receive  a  payoff  of  7,  and   the  participant 

88
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:08,068
 that  you  are  paired  with  receives  a  payoff 

89
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:12,187
 of  8.   This  combination  has  occurred  6  times 

90
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,697
 so  far  this  match.   If  you  choose  Y  and   the 

91
00:05:15,697 --> 00:05:18,560
 participant  you  are  paired  with  chooses  Y,  then 

92
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,134
  you  receive  a  payoff  of  1,  and   the  participant 

93
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:23,465
 that  you  are  paired  with  receives  a  payoff 

94
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:27,606
 of  2.   This  combination  has  occurred  6  times 

95
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:32,580
 so  far  this  match.   History  As  the  match  progresses, 

96
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,645
 you  will  see  the  history  of  play  across  the 

97
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:38,654
 top  of  the  screen,  displayed  like  this:   This 

98
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:41,599
 history  displays   the  period  (labeled  Period), 

99
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:45,876
  your  choice  in  that  period  (labeled  My  Choice), 

100
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:48,563
  the  choice  of  the  participant  you  are  paired 

101
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:51,559
 with  in  that  period  (labeled  Other's  Choice), 

102
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:55,297
 and   the  payoff  for  that  period  (labeled  My 

103
00:05:55,297 --> 00:05:59,627
 Payoff).  For  example,  in  the  above  history, 

104
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:03,736
  in  period  39,   you  played  W,   the  participant 

105
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:06,559
 you  are  paired  with  played  Y,   and  you  received 

106
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:11,551
 a  payoff  of  3.   Rules  Rather  than  directly 

107
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:14,760
 making  choices  of  W  or  Y,  you  will  develop 

108
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,380
 a  set  of  rules  which  will  automatically  make 

109
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,446
 choices  for  you.   The  set  of  rules  will  appear 

110
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,704
 in  the  middle  of  the  screen.   You  will  be 

111
00:06:23,704 --> 00:06:25,831
 able  to  construct  rules  using  the  rule  constructor 

112
00:06:25,831 --> 00:06:29,429
 at  the  bottom  of  the  screen.   A  rule  consists 

113
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:33,226
 of  two  parts:   Input  Sequence  - A  sequence  of 

114
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,663
 choices  made  by  you  and  the  participant  you 

115
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:39,336
 are  paired  with.   Output  - A  choice  to  be  made 

116
00:06:39,336 --> 00:06:43,109
 by  you  after  the  input  sequence  occurs.   Some 

117
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:46,213
 example  rules  are  displayed  below:   For  example, 

118
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:52,853
 Rule  #2  has  an  input  sequence  of   (Y,Y),   (W,W), 

119
00:06:52,853 --> 00:07:00,328
  (Y,W)  and  an  output  of   W.  This  means  that 

120
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:03,595
 if  you  have  played   Y,  W,  and  then  Y  in  the 

121
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:06,296
 last  three  periods,  and  the  participant  that 

122
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:08,949
 you  are  paired  with  has  played   Y,  W,  and 

123
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:11,556
 then  W,  this  rule  will  lead  you  to  play   W 

124
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:15,530
 in  the  next  period.  As  play  progresses  you 

125
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,947
 will  develop  a  set  of  rules  that  will  be  used 

126
00:07:17,947 --> 00:07:21,412
 to  make  your  choices.  Play  will  proceed  as 

127
00:07:21,412 --> 00:07:24,558
 follows:  Each  period,   your  set  of  rules  will 

128
00:07:24,558 --> 00:07:28,107
 select  the  choice  to  be  made  next  period.  The 

129
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:29,793
  rule  that  will  be  used  to  make  the  choice 

130
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:33,022
 will  be  highlighted.  The  corresponding   sequence 

131
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:36,618
 in  the  history  will  be  highlighted.  A   preview 

132
00:07:36,618 --> 00:07:38,965
 of  the  choice  to  be  made  next  period  will 

133
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:41,117
 be  shown  as  a  lightly  colored  cell  on  the 

134
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:44,652
 history  of  play.  In  order  to  move  to  the  next 

135
00:07:44,652 --> 00:07:47,137
 period,  you  have  to  confirm  the  choice  by  clicking 

136
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:51,038
 on  the  corresponding  history  cell.   Once  you 

137
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,255
 have  confirmed  your  choice,  the  light  color 

138
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:55,952
 will  turn  to  a  regular  color,  and  you  may 

139
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:58,258
 need  to  wait  for  the  participant  that  you  are 

140
00:07:58,258 --> 00:08:05,992
 paired  with  to  make  their  choice.   There  are 

141
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:08,139
 several  ways  that  you  can  modify  your  rules 

142
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:14,189
 during  the  experiment.  1.   First,  you  can  use 

143
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:16,661
 the  rule  constructor  in  the  bottom  center  of 

144
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:20,126
 the  screen.   Press  the  plus  button  to  add  more 

145
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:22,969
 columns,   or  one  of  the  minus  buttons  to  subtract 

146
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,574
 columns.  Click  on  the  question  marks  to  fill 

147
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:30,050
 in  the  boxes.  When  you  click  on  a  question 

148
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,228
 mark,   either  a  W  or  a  Y  will  appear.  If 

149
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:37,095
 you  click  on  a  W,   it  will  switch  to  a  Y, 

150
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:39,589
 and  if  you  click  on  a  Y,   it  will  switch 

151
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,231
 to  a  W.   Once  you  have  completely  filled  in 

152
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:47,109
 the  rule  (leaving  no  question  marks),   the  add 

153
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,526
 rule  button  will  appear,   and  the  rule  can 

154
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:55,216
 be  added  to  your  set.  2.  Second,  if  you  look 

155
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:57,442
 at  a  rule  in  the  set,   you  will  notice  a 

156
00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:59,580
 green  copy  button,   and  a  red  delete  button. 

157
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,356
 If  you   press  the  green  copy  button,  it  will 

158
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:05,689
 copy  the  rule  down  to  the  constructor,   and 

159
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:07,857
 you  will  be  able  to  create  a  similar  rule. 

160
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:13,331
 If  you   press  the  red  delete  button,  it  will 

161
00:09:13,331 --> 00:09:20,711
 delete  the  rule  from  the   set.  3.  Since  your 

162
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,932
 rule  set  needs  to  make  a  single  choice  each 

163
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:26,041
 period,  it  is  not  possible  to  have  two  rules 

164
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,427
 with  the  same  input  sequence,  but  with  different 

165
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:32,058
 outputs.   If  you  create  a  rule  that  has  the 

166
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:34,127
 same  input  sequence  but  a  different  output, 

167
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:36,326
 you  will  get  an  error  that   says  'Conflicting 

168
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,074
 rule  in  set",  and  a   button  that  says  'Switch 

169
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:42,239
 Rule"  will  appear.  If  you  press  this  button, 

170
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:44,822
 it  will  delete  the   conflicting  rule  from  the 

171
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:46,910
 rule  set,   and  add  the  rule  from  the   constructor. 

172
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:52,555
 The  length  of  the  rule  is  measured  by  the 

173
00:09:52,555 --> 00:09:55,929
 length  of  the  input  sequence.  So   rule  #2, 

174
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,797
 and   rule  #3  have  a  length  of  3,  and   rule 

175
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:03,769
 #4  has  a  length  of  2.  A  rule  of  length  n 

176
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,224
 is  said  to  fit  the  history  if  the  input  sequence 

177
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:08,490
 matches  the  last  n  periods  of  the  history. 

178
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,748
 For  example,  since  the  last  three  periods  of 

179
00:10:12,748 --> 00:10:16,435
 play  in  the  above  history   (periods  42  through 

180
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:25,835
 44)  have  been   (Y,  Y),   (W,  W),  and   (Y,  W), 

181
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:29,415
 and  that  sequence  is  also  the  input  for   rule 

182
00:10:29,415 --> 00:10:33,375
 #2,  then  rule  #2  is  said  to  fit  the  history. 

183
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:38,177
 Similarly,  given  the  above  history,  we  can  see 

184
00:10:38,177 --> 00:10:42,182
 that   rule  #4  fits  the  history,  but   rule  #3 

185
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:46,183
 does  not  fit  the  history.  If  more  than  one 

186
00:10:46,183 --> 00:10:48,809
 rule  fits  the  history,  then  the  rule  with  the 

187
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:52,198
 longer  length  will  determine  the  choice.  For 

188
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:55,208
 example,  given  the  above  history  since  both 

189
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,714
  rule  #2,  and   rule  #4  fit  the  history,   rule 

190
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:01,399
 #2  will  be  used  to  make  your  choice,  since 

191
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:05,296
 it  is  longer.  Therefore,  given  the  history, 

192
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:08,487
 and  the  rule  set,  your  choice  next  period  will 

193
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:15,447
  be  W,  as  prescribed  by   rule  #2.   If  no  rules 

194
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:18,021
 fit  the  history,  then  your   Default  Rule  will 

195
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:21,758
 be  selected.  The  default  rule  will  only  be 

196
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:25,236
 used  when  no  rules  fit  the  history.   To  select 

197
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:28,208
 your  default  rule  select  either   W,  or   Y, 

198
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,608
 in  the  bottom  left  of  your  screen.  Additionally, 

199
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,478
 you  have  to  select  the   First  Period  rule. 

200
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:37,997
 The  first  period  rule  will  only  be  used  in 

201
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,530
 the  first  period  of  the  match.  To  select  your 

202
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,492
 first  period  rule  select  either   W,  or   Y, 

203
00:11:44,492 --> 00:11:48,590
 in  the  bottom  left  of  your  screen.   Additional 

204
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:53,561
 Examples  In  the  example  above,   Rule  #4,  and 

205
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:58,412
  Rule  #9,  both  fit  the  history.  However,  rule 

206
00:11:58,412 --> 00:12:02,598
 #9  will  be  selected  because  it  is  longer.  Therefore, 

207
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:05,948
  W  will  be  played  in  the  next  period,   as 

208
00:12:05,948 --> 00:12:10,257
 prescribed  by  rule  #9.  For  the  example  above, 

209
00:12:10,257 --> 00:12:13,067
 how  can  we  change  the  rule  set  to  ensure  that 

210
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:16,451
 Y  is  played  next  period.  There  are  several 

211
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:18,991
 ways  to  make  changes  to  the  rule  set  in  order 

212
00:12:18,991 --> 00:12:22,868
 for  Y  to  be  played.  First,  you  can  delete 

213
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:26,229
  Rule  #9,  which  would  cause   Rule  #4  to  be 

214
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:28,805
 the  longest  rule  that  fits  the  history,   and 

215
00:12:28,805 --> 00:12:30,883
 therefore  would  lead  to  Y  being  played  next 

216
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:39,856
 period.   Second,  you   can  add  a  longer  rule 

217
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:42,207
 that  fits  the  history  that  has  Y  as  the  output. 

218
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:45,868
 Since  you  added  a  longer  rule  that  fits  the 

219
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:48,604
 history,  that  rule  will  be  used  to  make  the 

220
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:50,881
 choice,  and  will  select  Y  as  the  choice  for 

221
00:12:50,881 --> 00:13:00,998
 next  period.   Number  of  Periods  Per  Match  The 

222
00:13:00,998 --> 00:13:03,087
 number  of  periods  in  each  match  will  be  determined 

223
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:07,078
 randomly  using  the  following  procedure.  At  the 

224
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,592
 end  of  each  period,   a  number  will  be  chosen 

225
00:13:09,592 --> 00:13:14,336
 randomly  from  the  set  of  numbers   {1,2,3,  up 

226
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:19,938
 to,48,49,50},  where  each  number  is  equally  likely. 

227
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:24,034
  If  the  number  is  1,  then  the  match  will  end. 

228
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:27,940
  If  the  number  is  not  1,  then  the  match  will 

229
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,569
 continue.  The  number  will  always  be  placed  back 

230
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:35,636
 into  the  set  after  it  is  drawn.  Thus,  in  any 

231
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:38,243
 period  there  is  a  2  percent  CHANCE  that  the 

232
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:40,742
 match  will  end,  and  a  98  percent  CHANCE  that 

233
00:13:40,742 --> 00:13:44,006
 the  match  will  have  another  period.  Therefore, 

234
00:13:44,006 --> 00:13:47,261
  the  expected  number  of  periods  in  each  match 

235
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:50,585
 will  be  50.   This  procedure  has  been  performed 

236
00:13:50,585 --> 00:13:54,481
 on  the  computer  before  the  experiment.  Therefore, 

237
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:57,394
 you  will  not  see  the  number  selected  from  {1,2,3, 

238
00:13:57,394 --> 00:14:06,045
 up  to,48,49,50}.  To  ensure  that  the  length  of 

239
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,436
 the  match  is  not  dependent  on  your  play,  the 

240
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:10,637
 number  of  periods  for  each  match  has  be  written 

241
00:14:10,637 --> 00:14:13,206
 on  the  board  before  the  experiment,  and  will 

242
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:14,875
 be  uncovered  at  the  end  of  the  experiment. 

243
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:18,251
  Your  choices  will  be  determined   automatically 

244
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:22,354
 from  your  rule  set.  However,  you  will  need 

245
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:24,470
 to  confirm  the   choice  within  an  allotted  amount 

246
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,154
 of  time.  To  confirm  your  choice,   click  on 

247
00:14:28,154 --> 00:14:30,377
 your  action  for  the  next  period  within  the 

248
00:14:30,377 --> 00:14:33,827
 history  at  the  top  of  the  screen.  If  you  don't 

249
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:36,113
 confirm  the  choice  within  the  allotted  amount 

250
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:38,016
 of  time,   then  the  choice  will  be  confirmed 

251
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:40,679
 automatically  at  the  end  of  the  allotted  time. 

252
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,173
 The  experiment  will  not  be  able  to  proceed 

253
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:47,699
 until  everyone  confirms  their  choices.   Everyone 

254
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,008
 in  your  group  will  have  the  same  amount  of 

255
00:14:50,008 --> 00:14:54,548
 time  allotted  in  each  period.   Additional  Information 

256
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:58,116
 about  Matches  During  matches  1  through  10  you 

257
00:14:58,116 --> 00:15:00,313
 will  be  able  to  construct  the  set  of  rules 

258
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:03,503
 to  make  your  choices.   All  of  the  rules  in 

259
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,466
 your  set  at  the  end  of  one  match  will  remain 

260
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:07,626
 in  your  set  at  the  start  of  the  next  match. 

261
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:11,322
  Before  the  first  match,   you  will  have  1  minute 

262
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:13,494
 to  look  over  the  payoffs,   and  an  additional 

263
00:15:13,494 --> 00:15:17,450
 10  minute  to  construct  your  rules.   Editing 

264
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,052
 your  set  of  rules  In  the  experiment  today  you 

265
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:23,072
 will  need  to  pay  a  cost  to  edit  rules  during 

266
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:27,321
 the  match.  More  specifically,  Before  each  match 

267
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:29,946
 starts,  you  can  make  changes  to  your  set  of 

268
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:33,481
 rules  at  no  cost.  After  each  match  starts, 

269
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:36,092
 if  you  want  to  make  changes  to  your  set  of 

270
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:38,205
 rules,   you  must  click  the  'Unlock  Rules"  button. 

271
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:41,958
 The  cost  for  clicking  the  'Unlock  Rules"  button 

272
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:46,037
 is  0  Francs.  The  total  cost  incurred  in  all 

273
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:48,343
 matches   will  be  displayed  at  the  top  of  the 

274
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:51,736
 screen  in  red.  You  will  be  able  to  edit  your 

275
00:15:51,736 --> 00:15:55,013
 rules  for  the  duration  of  one  period.  Once 

276
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:57,192
 you  are  done  editing  your  rules  you  may  click 

277
00:15:57,192 --> 00:16:00,211
 the  'Lock  Rules"   button.  If  you  don't  want 

278
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:02,552
 to  make  changes  to  your  set  of  rules,  you 

279
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:04,548
 may  choose  not  to  click  the  'Unlock  Rule"  button. 

280
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:08,617
 Then  you  will  not  incur  the  cost  of  0  Francs. 

281
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:12,225
 In  either  case,  you  will  need  to  confirm  the 

282
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:14,227
 choice  made  within  the  time  limit  set  for  each 

283
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:18,205
 period.  If  the  time  limit  within  a  period  is 

284
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:20,674
 reached,  your  rules  will  become  locked,  your 

285
00:16:20,674 --> 00:16:23,313
 choice  will  be  confirmed  automatically,  and  you 

286
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:27,605
 will  proceed  to  the  next  period.   Starting  Rules 

287
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:31,065
 Prior  to  the  start  of  the  experiment  you  will 

288
00:16:31,065 --> 00:16:33,267
 have  10  minutes  to  construct  your  starting  set 

289
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:36,839
 of  rules.  During  that  time,  you  will  be  presented 

290
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,120
 with  a  split-screen  view  of  of  the  construction 

291
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,883
 screen.  In  this  view,  you  will  have  an  opportunity 

292
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:45,286
 to  test  what  your  rule  set  will  select  as 

293
00:16:45,286 --> 00:16:48,032
 an  output  for  a  variety  of  hypothetical  histories. 

294
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:51,921
 The  split-screen  will  consist  of  two  sides. 

295
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:55,550
  The  right  side  is  the  Starting  Rules  side. 

296
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,975
 Rules  added  to  this  side  will  be  added  to 

297
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:00,942
 your  rule  set  at  the  start  of  the  first  match. 

298
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:04,726
  The  left  side  is  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side. 

299
00:17:04,726 --> 00:17:08,257
 Rules  added  to  this  side  can  be  used  to  test 

300
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:11,015
 to  see  what  choices  different  combinations  of 

301
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:14,482
 rules  will  lead  to.  You  will  be  able  to  move 

302
00:17:14,482 --> 00:17:16,940
 rules  from  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side  to  the 

303
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,988
 Starting  Rules  side   by  clicking  the  blue  move 

304
00:17:18,988 --> 00:17:22,973
 button.  To  delete  rules  from  either  side,   you 

305
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:26,142
 need  to  click  the  delete  button.  You  will  be 

306
00:17:26,142 --> 00:17:27,607
 able  to  see  what  choice   your  hypothetical, 

307
00:17:27,607 --> 00:17:30,762
 and   your  starting  rule  sets  select  as  a  choice 

308
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:32,967
 for  next  period,  for  each  of  the  hypothetical 

309
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:37,039
 histories  that  you  construct.  Notice  that  you 

310
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,639
 will  be  able  to  construct,  and  store,  multiple 

311
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:43,581
 histories   at  the  same  time.  You  can  view  one 

312
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:46,132
 of  the  other  hypothetical  histories  by  clicking 

313
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,865
 the   History  #  button  at  the  top  of  the  Hypothetical 

314
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:52,215
 Rules  side.  You  can  add  a  new  hypothetical 

315
00:17:52,215 --> 00:17:55,056
 history  by  clicking  the   New  button  at  the 

316
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:58,434
 top  of  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side.  To  construct 

317
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:01,275
 a  hypothetical  history  you  will  need  to  click 

318
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:04,547
 on  the   question  marks  in  that  history.  You 

319
00:18:04,547 --> 00:18:07,169
 don't  need  to  fill  out  the  entire  history  to 

320
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,183
 see  what  choice  your  rule  set  will  make.  Therefore, 

321
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:13,075
 it  is  useful  to  start  filling  out  the  new 

322
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:15,655
 histories  from  the  most  recent  periods  on  the 

323
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:20,133
 right  side.  Let's  look  at  an  example.   Five 

324
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:23,597
 periods  of  hypothetical  History  #4  have  been 

325
00:18:23,597 --> 00:18:27,120
 filled  in.   The  hypothetical  rule  set  will  play 

326
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,276
 W  after  this  history  occurs.   The  starting  rule 

327
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,724
 set  will  play  Y  after  this  history  occurs. 

328
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:43,698
  Let's  look  at  another  example.   14  periods 

329
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:47,114
 of  hypothetical  History  #3  have  been  filled 

330
00:18:47,114 --> 00:18:50,756
 in.   The  hypothetical  rule  set  will  play  Y 

331
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:54,460
 after  this  history  occurs.   The  starting  rule 

332
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,908
 set  will  play  Y  after  this  history  occurs. 

333
00:18:56,908 --> 00:19:05,621
 You  will  be  able  to  make  changes  to  your  Hypothetical 

334
00:19:05,621 --> 00:19:08,877
 Rules,  and  your  Starting  Rules,  for  the  duration 

335
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:12,716
 of  the  10  minutes.  After  the  ten  minutes  are 

336
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:15,048
 up,  rules  that  are  on  the  Starting  Rules  side 

337
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:17,045
 will  be  your  starting  rules  for  the  experiment. 

338
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:22,898
  Payoffs   At  the  end  of  the  experiment,  you 

339
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:26,214
 will  be  paid  in  cash.   Your  payoff  at  the 

340
00:19:26,214 --> 00:19:28,501
 end  of  the  experiment  will  be  the  sum  of  the 

341
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,217
 payoffs  for  each  period.   Reminder,  the  exchange 

342
00:19:32,217 --> 00:19:36,144
 rate  today  is  1250  Francs  equals  1  dollar. 

343
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:41,405
  Practice  Match  Next,  there  will  be  a  practice 

344
00:19:41,405 --> 00:19:43,053
 match  to  make  sure  that  you  are  comfortable 

345
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:47,182
 with  the  interface.  It  is  important  to  note 

346
00:19:47,182 --> 00:19:49,314
 that  in  this  practice  match,   you  will  NOT 

347
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:52,423
 be  paid  for  the  choices  made.   the  payoffs 

348
00:19:52,423 --> 00:19:55,370
 are  all  listed  as  0,  so  that  you  can  focus 

349
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,051
 on  getting  comfortable  with  the  interface,  rather 

350
00:19:58,051 --> 00:20:01,631
 than  focusing  on  the  payoffs.   You  are  NOT 

351
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:04,936
 paired  with  another  participant.  Your  opponent 

352
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:08,570
 for  the  practice  match  is  a  computer  that  is
