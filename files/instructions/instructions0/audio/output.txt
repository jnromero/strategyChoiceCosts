144.625	  Experiment
145.622	 Details
146.809	  This
147.032	 experiment
147.924	 consists
148.371	 of
148.594	 ten
148.817	 matches.
150.476	  Prior
150.858	 to
151.048	 start
151.239	 of
151.430	 the
151.621	 experiment,
152.571	 all
152.799	 participants
153.713	 may
153.942	 be
154.170	 split
154.399	 into
154.856	 two
155.084	 groups.
156.504	 The
156.691	 groups
156.878	 will
157.064	 stay
157.251	 fixed
157.438	 and
157.625	 you
157.811	 will
157.998	 know
158.185	 the
158.372	 number
158.745	 of
158.932	 participants
159.679	 in
159.866	 your
160.053	 group
160.240	 throughout
160.613	 the
160.800	 experiment.
162.746	  At
162.959	 the
163.172	 beginning
163.810	 of
164.023	 each
164.235	 match,
164.639	 you
164.831	 will
165.023	 be
165.215	 paired
165.407	 randomly
165.983	 with
166.175	 one
166.368	 other
166.752	 participant
167.520	 from
167.712	 your
167.904	 group.
169.296	 You
169.479	 will
169.662	 remain
170.028	 matched
170.210	 with
170.393	 this
170.576	 same
170.759	 participant
171.491	 until
171.857	 the
172.039	 end
172.222	 of
172.405	 the
172.588	 match,
172.978	 but
173.163	 then
173.348	 will
173.533	 be
173.717	 paired
173.902	 with
174.087	 another
174.642	 randomly
175.196	 selected
175.751	 participant
176.490	 from
176.675	 your
176.860	 group
177.045	 in
177.230	 the
177.415	 following
177.969	 match.
179.339	 Each
179.591	 match
179.842	 will
180.094	 have
180.345	 the
180.597	 same
180.849	 structure,
181.547	  but
181.732	 may
181.917	 contain
182.287	 different
182.843	 numbers
183.213	 of
183.398	 periods.
185.151	  You
185.310	 will
185.469	 remain
185.788	 anonymous
186.424	 throughout
186.742	 the
186.901	 experiment.
188.735	 You
188.911	 will
189.088	 not
189.264	 know
189.440	 the
189.616	 identity
190.321	 of
190.498	 the
190.674	 participant
191.379	 that
191.555	 you
191.731	 are
191.908	 paired
192.084	 with,
192.450	 and
192.616	 they
192.782	 will
192.947	 not
193.113	 know
193.279	 your
193.445	 identity.
195.297	  The
195.546	 choices
196.043	 made
196.292	 by
196.540	 you,
196.971	 and
197.155	 the
197.339	 participant
198.074	 you
198.258	 are
198.441	 paired
198.625	 with,
198.996	 have
199.204	 no
199.411	 effect
199.827	 on
200.035	 the
200.242	 payoffs
200.658	 of
200.865	 participants
201.696	 in
201.904	 other
202.319	 pairs,
202.706	 and
202.941	 vice
203.177	 versa.
204.817	 Therefore,
205.722	 your
205.911	 payoff
206.288	 in
206.477	 a
206.666	 given
207.043	 match
207.232	 is
207.421	 based
207.609	 solely
207.987	 on
208.176	 the
208.364	 choices
208.742	 made
208.930	 by
209.119	 you
209.308	 and
209.497	 the
209.685	 participant
210.440	 that
210.629	 you
210.818	 are
211.007	 paired
211.195	 with.
212.573	  Next,
213.362	 Let's
213.547	 Look
213.731	 at
213.916	 the
214.101	 experimental
215.024	 Interface

221.273	 Your
221.460	 payoff
221.833	 in
222.019	 each
222.206	 period
222.765	 will
222.952	 depend
223.325	 on
223.511	 your
223.698	 choice
223.885	 and
224.071	 the
224.258	 choice
224.444	 of
224.631	 the
224.817	 participant
225.563	 that
225.750	 you
225.936	 are
226.123	 paired
226.309	 with.
227.673	 You
227.897	 will
228.121	 choose
228.345	 one
228.569	 of
228.793	 two
229.017	 options,
229.654	 either
230.065	 W
230.680	 or
230.886	 Y.
232.076	 You
232.255	 will
232.434	 be
232.613	 able
232.972	 to
233.151	 see
233.330	 the
233.509	 payoffs
233.867	 for
234.046	 each

234.942	 of
235.121	 choices
235.479	 for
235.658	 you
235.838	 and
236.017	 the

236.912	 that
237.091	 you

239.012	 These
239.204	 payoffs
239.589	 will
239.781	 remain

531.964	 2.
534.066	 Second,
534.847	 if

535.585	 a
535.770	 rule
535.954	 in

635.144	 Similarly,
636.165	 given
636.513	 the

637.035	 history,
637.742	 we
637.959	 can

691.608	 Additionally,
692.658	 you

693.022	 to
693.204	 select
693.568	 the
693.750	  First
693.932	 Period

695.845	 The
696.041	 first

698.192	 the
698.388	 first
698.583	 period
699.170	 of
699.366	 the
699.561	 match.
700.963	 To
701.152	 select
701.530	 your
701.719	 first
701.908	 period
702.475	 rule
702.664	 select

708.590	  Additional
709.384	 Examples
710.668	 In
710.857	 the
711.047	 example
711.614	 above,
712.176	  Rule
712.472	 #4,
713.561	 and
713.825	  Rule
714.089	 #9,
715.089	 both
715.302	 fit
715.515	 the
715.727	 history.
717.578	 However,
718.412	 rule
718.612	 #9
719.211	 will
719.410	 be
719.610	 selected
720.209	 because
720.608	 it
720.808	 is
721.008	 longer.
722.598	 Therefore,
723.508	  W
724.071	 will
724.259	 be
724.447	 played
724.635	 in
724.822	 the
725.010	 next
725.198	 period,
725.948	  as
726.215	 prescribed
726.748	 by
727.014	 rule
727.281	 #9.
729.263	 For
729.462	 the
729.660	 example
730.257	 above,
730.848	 how
731.070	 can
731.292	 we
731.514	 change
731.736	 the
731.957	 rule
732.179	 set
732.401	 to
732.623	 ensure
733.067	 that
733.289	 Y
733.511	 is
733.733	 played
733.954	 next
734.176	 period.
736.028	 There
736.240	 are
736.451	 several
736.874	 ways
737.086	 to
737.298	 make
737.509	 changes
737.933	 to
738.144	 the
738.356	 rule
738.567	 set
738.779	 in
738.991	 order
739.414	 for
739.626	 Y
739.837	 to
740.049	 be
740.260	 played.
741.667	 First,
742.390	 you
742.629	 can
742.868	 delete
743.346	  Rule
743.584	 #9,
744.485	 which
744.703	 would
744.921	 cause
745.139	  Rule
745.357	 #4
746.011	 to
746.229	 be
746.447	 the
746.666	 longest
747.102	 rule
747.320	 that
747.538	 fits
747.756	 the
747.974	 history,
748.805	  and
749.013	 therefore
749.428	 would
749.636	 lead
749.844	 to
750.052	 Y
750.259	 being
750.675	 played
750.883	 next
751.091	 period.
757.899	  Second,
758.680	 you
758.876	  can
759.072	 add
759.268	 a
759.464	 longer
759.856	 rule
760.052	 that
760.248	 fits
760.444	 the
760.640	 history
761.227	 that
761.423	 has
761.619	 Y
761.815	 as
762.011	 the
762.207	 output.
763.789	 Since
763.997	 you
764.205	 added
764.621	 a
764.829	 longer
765.245	 rule
765.452	 that
765.660	 fits
765.868	 the
766.076	 history,
766.877	 that
767.124	 rule
767.371	 will
767.617	 be
767.864	 used
768.111	 to
768.358	 make
768.604	 the
768.851	 choice,
769.277	 and
769.478	 will
769.678	 select
770.079	 Y
770.280	 as
770.480	 the
770.681	 choice
770.881	 for
771.082	 next
771.282	 period.
778.569	  Number
779.002	 of
779.219	 Periods
779.869	 Per
780.085	 Match
780.998	 The
781.172	 number
781.520	 of
781.694	 periods
782.217	 in
782.391	 each
782.565	 match
782.739	 will
782.913	 be
783.087	 determined
783.610	 randomly
784.132	 using
784.480	 the
784.654	 following
785.177	 procedure.
786.895	 At
787.078	 the
787.261	 end
787.444	 of
787.627	 each
787.810	 period,
788.548	  a
788.757	 number
789.174	 will
789.383	 be
789.592	 chosen
790.010	 randomly
790.636	 from
790.845	 the
791.054	 set
791.263	 of
791.471	 numbers
791.889	  {1,2,3,
794.336	 up
794.669	 to,48,49,50},
798.396	 where
798.589	 each
798.781	 number
799.167	 is
799.360	 equally
799.938	 likely.
801.517	  If
801.748	 the
801.979	 number
802.442	 is
802.673	 1,
803.096	 then
803.331	 the
803.565	 match
803.800	 will
804.034	 end.
805.454	  If
805.691	 the
805.928	 number
806.401	 is
806.638	 not
806.875	 1,
807.309	 then
807.519	 the
807.730	 match
807.940	 will
808.151	 continue.
809.963	 The
810.164	 number
810.565	 will
810.766	 always
811.167	 be
811.368	 placed
811.569	 back
811.769	 into
812.171	 the
812.372	 set
812.572	 after
812.974	 it
813.175	 is
813.375	 drawn.
814.757	 Thus,
815.435	 in
815.636	 any
816.037	 period
816.638	 there
816.839	 is
817.039	 a
817.240	 2
817.441	 percent
817.842	 CHANCE
818.042	 that
818.243	 the
818.443	 match
818.644	 will
818.844	 end,
819.230	 and
819.419	 a
819.608	 98
820.175	 percent
820.553	 CHANCE
820.742	 that
820.931	 the
821.121	 match
821.310	 will
821.499	 have
821.688	 another
822.255	 period.
824.006	 Therefore,
824.915	  the
825.111	 expected
825.697	 number
826.088	 of
826.284	 periods
826.870	 in
827.066	 each
827.261	 match
827.457	 will
827.652	 be
827.848	 50.
829.425	  This
829.618	 procedure
830.199	 has
830.392	 been
830.585	 performed
830.972	 on
831.166	 the
831.359	 computer
831.939	 before
832.326	 the
832.519	 experiment.
834.481	 Therefore,
835.386	 you
835.569	 will
835.751	 not
835.934	 see
836.116	 the
836.299	 number
836.664	 selected
837.211	 from
837.394	 {1,2,3,
839.844	 up
840.178	 to,48,49,50}.
844.842	 To

846.446	 match
846.647	 is
846.847	 not
847.048	 dependent
847.649	 on
847.850	 your
848.050	 play,
848.436	 the
848.619	 number
848.986	 of
849.170	 periods
849.720	 for
849.904	 each
850.087	 match

1084.950	 need

1090.183	 Therefore,
1091.090	 it
1091.288	 is
1091.487	 useful
