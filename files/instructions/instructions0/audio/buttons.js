var links=[[0.015,' Welcome  to  the  Vernon  Smith  Experimental  Economics  Laboratory  '],[5.147,'  Please  carefully  watch  these  video  instructions  and  follow  along  on  the  paper  copy  at  your  desk  '],[12.365,'  Experiment  Overview '],[14.972,'  You  are  about  to  participate  in  an  experiment  in  the  economics  of  decision making  '],[20.657,'  If  you  listen  carefully '],[22.218,'   you  could  earn  a  large  amount  of  money '],[24.235,'   that  will  be  paid  to  you  in  cash '],[26.234,'   in  private '],[27.105,'   at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[29.898,'  It  is  important  that  you  remain  silent  and  do  not  look  at  other  people\'s  work  '],[35.051,'  If  you  have  any  questions '],[36.877,'   or  need  any  assistance  of  any  kind '],[39.229,'   please  raise  your  hand  and  an  experimenter  will  help  you  out  '],[43.490,'  During  the  experiment '],[44.999,'   do  not  talk '],[45.974,'   laugh  or  exclaim  out  loud  and  be  sure  to  keep  your  eyes  on  your  screen  only  '],[51.096,'  In  addition '],[52.081,'   please  turn  off  your  cell  phones '],[53.981,'   etc  '],[55.784,'  and  put  them  away  during  the  experiment  '],[59.036,'  Anybody  that  violates  these  rules  will  be  asked  to  leave  and  will  not  be  paid  '],[64.057,'  We  expect '],[64.826,'   and  appreciate  your  cooperation  '],[68.456,'  Agenda '],[69.749,'  one  '],[71.902,'  We  will  first  go  over  the  instructions  '],[75.384,'  two  '],[77.482,'  Then  we  will  have  a  practice  match  to  learn  the  interface  '],[81.569,'  three  '],[83.798,'  Next '],[84.594,'   there  will  be  a  quiz  with  ten  questions  to  make  sure  everyone  understands  the  instructions  '],[91.630,'  All  ten  questions  will  refer  to  these  instructions  so  you  should  follow  them  carefully  '],[97.335,'  If  you  answer  all  questions  correctly  you  will  earn  ten  dollars  '],[102.846,'  If  you  answer  at  least  one  question  incorrectly  you  will  earn  nothing '],[106.406,'   at  which  point  you  will  not  need  to  answer  any  more  questions  '],[111.789,'  You  will  have  ten  minutes  to  answer  the  ten  questions  '],[115.705,'  four  '],[117.948,'  After  the  quiz '],[119.141,'   you  will  have  ten  minutes  to  prepare  for  the  experiment  '],[123.106,'  In  the  experiment  you  will  be  working  with  a  fictitious  currency  called  Francs  '],[128.471,'  You  will  be  paid  in  US  Dollars  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[132.977,'  The  exchange  rate  today  is '],[135.281,'  one thousand two hundred and fifty  Francs  equals  one  u s dollars  '],[144.625,'  Experiment  Details '],[146.809,'  This  experiment  consists  of  ten  matches  '],[150.476,'  Prior  to  start  of  the  experiment '],[152.571,'   all  participants  may  be  split  into  two  groups  '],[156.504,'  The  groups  will  stay  fixed  and  you  will  know  the  number  of  participants  in  your  group  throughout  the  experiment  '],[162.746,'  At  the  beginning  of  each  match '],[164.639,'   you  will  be  paired  randomly  with  one  other  participant  from  your  group  '],[169.296,'  You  will  remain  matched  with  this  same  participant  until  the  end  of  the  match '],[172.978,'   but  then  will  be  paired  with  another  randomly  selected  participant  from  your  group  in  the  following  match  '],[179.339,'  Each  match  will  have  the  same  structure '],[181.547,'   but  may  contain  different  numbers  of  periods  '],[185.151,'  You  will  remain  anonymous  throughout  the  experiment  '],[188.735,'  You  will  not  know  the  identity  of  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with '],[192.450,'   and  they  will  not  know  your  identity  '],[195.297,'  The  choices  made  by  you '],[196.971,'   and  the  participant  you  are  paired  with '],[198.996,'   have  no  effect  on  the  payoffs  of  participants  in  other  pairs '],[202.706,'   and  vice  versa  '],[204.817,'  Therefore '],[205.722,'   your  payoff  in  a  given  match  is  based  solely  on  the  choices  made  by  you  and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  '],[212.573,'  Next '],[213.362,'   Let\'s  Look  at  the  experimental  Interface '],[218.269,'  Specific  Instructions  for  Each  Period '],[221.273,'  Your  payoff  in  each  period  will  depend  on  your  choice  and  the  choice  of  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  '],[227.673,'  You  will  choose  one  of  two  options '],[229.654,'   either  W  or  Y  '],[232.076,'  You  will  be  able  to  see  the  payoffs  for  each  combination  of  choices  for  you  and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  '],[239.012,'  These  payoffs  will  remain  the  same  throughout  the  entire  experiment '],[243.173,'   all  matches   '],[245.726,'  The  payoffs  will  be  displayed  in  a  table  like  this '],[248.880,'  In  this  example  above '],[250.374,'   the  rows  are  the  following '],[252.404,'  Row   number one  '],[253.659,' Your  choice '],[255.619,'   either  W  or  Y  in  this  example  '],[258.877,'  Row   number two  '],[260.146,' Other\'s  choice '],[262.320,'   either  W  or  Y  in  this  example  '],[266.578,'  Row   number three  '],[267.822,' Your  payoff  '],[269.789,'  Row   number four  '],[271.056,' Other\'s  payoff  '],[273.242,'  Row   number five  '],[274.608,' Total  number  of  times  that  that  combination  has  been  played  this  match  '],[279.689,'  Examples '],[281.193,'  In  the  table  above '],[282.584,'   if  you  choose  W  and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  chooses  Y '],[286.982,'   then  you  receive  a  payoff  of  three '],[289.115,'   and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  receives  a  payoff  of  four  '],[293.847,'  This  combination  has  occurred  nineteen  times  so  far  this  match  '],[298.691,'  If  you  choose  W  and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  chooses  W '],[303.188,'   then  you  receive  a  payoff  of  seven '],[305.436,'   and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  receives  a  payoff  of  eight  '],[310.006,'  This  combination  has  occurred  six  times  so  far  this  match  '],[314.589,'  If  you  choose  Y  and  the  participant  you  are  paired  with  chooses  Y '],[318.560,'   then  you  receive  a  payoff  of  one '],[320.746,'   and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  receives  a  payoff  of  two  '],[325.425,'  This  combination  has  occurred  six  times  so  far  this  match  '],[330.522,'  History '],[331.880,'  As  the  match  progresses '],[333.475,'   you  will  see  the  history  of  play  across  the  top  of  the  screen '],[336.834,'   displayed  like  this '],[338.654,'  This  history  displays  the  period '],[341.232,'   labeled  Period  '],[342.832,'  your  choice  in  that  period '],[344.958,'   labeled  My  Choice  '],[346.881,'  the  choice  of  the  participant  you  are  paired  with  in  that  period '],[350.424,'   labeled  Other\'s  Choice  '],[352.531,'  and  the  payoff  for  that  period '],[354.801,'   labeled  My  Payoff   '],[357.758,'  For  example '],[358.912,'   in  the  above  history '],[360.362,'   in  period  thirty nine '],[362.145,'   you  played  W '],[363.515,'   the  participant  you  are  paired  with  played  Y '],[366.137,'   and  you  received  a  payoff  of  three  '],[369.725,'  Rules '],[370.940,'  Rather  than  directly  making  choices  of  W  or  Y '],[374.386,'   you  will  develop  a  set  of  rules  which  will  automatically  make  choices  for  you  '],[379.506,'  The  set  of  rules  will  appear  in  the  middle  of  the  screen  '],[383.317,'  You  will  be  able  to  construct  rules  using  the  rule  constructor  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen  '],[388.947,'  A  rule  consists  of  two  parts '],[391.323,'  Input  Sequence  '],[392.617,' A  sequence  of  choices  made  by  you  and  the  participant  you  are  paired  with  '],[397.663,'  Output  '],[398.476,' A  choice  to  be  made  by  you  after  the  input  sequence  occurs  '],[403.109,'  Some  example  rules  are  displayed  below '],[405.965,'  For  example '],[407.121,'   Rule   number two  has  an  input  sequence  of '],[410.295,'   Y '],[410.961,' Y  '],[412.853,'   W '],[413.719,' W  '],[415.456,'   Y '],[416.140,' W  '],[417.365,'  and  an  output  of  W  '],[419.847,'  This  means  that  if  you  have  played  Y '],[421.972,'   W '],[422.775,'   and  then  Y  in  the  last  three  periods '],[425.015,'   and  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  has  played  Y '],[428.210,'   W '],[428.949,'   and  then  W '],[430.172,'   this  rule  will  lead  you  to  play  W  in  the  next  period  '],[434.523,'  As  play  progresses  you  will  develop  a  set  of  rules  that  will  be  used  to  make  your  choices  '],[440.375,'  Play  will  proceed  as  follows '],[442.876,'  Each  period '],[443.770,'   your  set  of  rules  will  select  the  choice  to  be  made  next  period  '],[448.107,'  The  rule  that  will  be  used  to  make  the  choice  will  be  highlighted  '],[452.105,'  The  corresponding  sequence  in  the  history  will  be  highlighted  '],[456.422,'  A  preview  of  the  choice  to  be  made  next  period  will  be  shown  as  a  lightly  colored  cell  on  the  history  of  play  '],[463.456,'  In  order  to  move  to  the  next  period '],[465.523,'   you  have  to  confirm  the  choice  by  clicking  on  the  corresponding  history  cell  '],[470.764,'  Once  you  have  confirmed  your  choice '],[472.867,'   the  light  color  will  turn  to  a  regular  color '],[475.568,'   and  you  may  need  to  wait  for  the  participant  that  you  are  paired  with  to  make  their  choice  '],[485.797,'  There  are  several  ways  that  you  can  modify  your  rules  during  the  experiment  '],[490.886,'  one  '],[493.055,'  First '],[493.777,'   you  can  use  the  rule  constructor  in  the  bottom  center  of  the  screen  '],[498.490,'  Press  the  plus  button  to  add  more  columns '],[501.017,'   or  one  of  the  minus  buttons  to  subtract  columns  '],[505.041,'  Click  on  the  question  marks  to  fill  in  the  boxes  '],[508.884,'  When  you  click  on  a  question  mark '],[510.939,'   either  a  W  or  a  Y  will  appear  '],[514.228,'  If  you  click  on  a  W '],[515.911,'   it  will  switch  to  a  Y '],[517.520,'   and  if  you  click  on  a  Y '],[519.181,'   it  will  switch  to  a  W  '],[521.795,'  Once  you  have  completely  filled  in  the  rule '],[524.531,'   leaving  no  question  marks  '],[526.865,'  the  add  rule  button  will  appear '],[529.002,'   and  the  rule  can  be  added  to  your  set  '],[531.964,'  two  '],[534.066,'  Second '],[534.847,'   if  you  look  at  a  rule  in  the  set '],[536.696,'   you  will  notice  a  green  copy  button '],[538.730,'   and  a  red  delete  button  '],[541.115,'  If  you  press  the  green  copy  button '],[543.159,'   it  will  copy  the  rule  down  to  the  constructor '],[545.689,'   and  you  will  be  able  to  create  a  similar  rule  '],[551.221,'  If  you  press  the  red  delete  button '],[553.115,'   it  will  delete  the  rule  from  the  set  '],[558.257,'  three  '],[560.489,'  Since  your  rule  set  needs  to  make  a  single  choice  each  period '],[564.013,'   it  is  not  possible  to  have  two  rules  with  the  same  input  sequence '],[568.055,'   but  with  different  outputs  '],[570.554,'  If  you  create  a  rule  that  has  the  same  input  sequence  but  a  different  output '],[574.688,'   you  will  get  an  error  that  says  Conflicting  rule  in  set '],[577.753,'   and  a  button  that  says  Switch  Rule  will  appear  '],[581.364,'  If  you  press  this  button '],[582.857,'   it  will  delete  the  conflicting  rule  from  the  rule  set '],[585.599,'   and  add  the  rule  from  the  constructor  '],[590.759,'  The  length  of  the  rule  is  measured  by  the  length  of  the  input  sequence  '],[595.343,'  So  rule   number two '],[597.003,'   and  rule   number three  have  a  length  of  three '],[599.570,'   and  rule   number four  has  a  length  of  two  '],[603.014,'  A  rule  of  length  n  is  said  to  fit  the  history  if  the  input  sequence  matches  the  last  n  periods  of  the  history  '],[610.261,'  For  example '],[611.421,'   since  the  last  three  periods  of  play  in  the  above  history '],[615.164,'   periods  forty two  through  forty four  '],[617.986,'  have  been '],[619.342,'   Y '],[620.008,'   Y  '],[621.901,'   W '],[622.766,'   W  '],[624.001,'  and '],[625.151,'   Y '],[625.835,'   W  '],[627.063,'  and  that  sequence  is  also  the  input  for  rule   number two '],[631.465,'  then  rule   number two  is  said  to  fit  the  history  '],[635.144,'  Similarly '],[636.165,'   given  the  above  history '],[637.742,'   we  can  see  that  rule   number four  fits  the  history '],[641.755,'  but  rule   number three  does  not  fit  the  history  '],[645.512,'  If  more  than  one  rule  fits  the  history '],[647.940,'   then  the  rule  with  the  longer  length  will  determine  the  choice  '],[652.198,'  For  example '],[653.367,'   given  the  above  history  since  both  rule   number two '],[656.423,'   and  rule   number four  fit  the  history '],[658.714,'   rule   number two  will  be  used  to  make  your  choice '],[661.399,'   since  it  is  longer  '],[663.846,'  Therefore '],[664.766,'   given  the  history '],[666.005,'   and  the  rule  set '],[667.141,'   your  choice  next  period  will  be  W '],[669.796,'   as  prescribed  by  rule   number two  '],[675.012,'  If  no  rules  fit  the  history '],[676.934,'   then  your  Default  Rule  will  be  selected  '],[680.304,'  The  default  rule  will  only  be  used  when  no  rules  fit  the  history  '],[685.046,'  To  select  your  default  rule  select  either  W '],[687.891,'   or  Y '],[688.689,'   in  the  bottom  left  of  your  screen  '],[691.608,'  Additionally '],[692.658,'   you  have  to  select  the  First  Period  rule  '],[695.845,'  The  first  period  rule  will  only  be  used  in  the  first  period  of  the  match  '],[700.963,'  To  select  your  first  period  rule  select  either  W '],[704.171,'   or  Y '],[704.968,'   in  the  bottom  left  of  your  screen  '],[708.590,'  Additional  Examples '],[710.668,'  In  the  example  above '],[712.176,'   Rule   number four '],[713.561,'   and  Rule   number nine '],[715.089,'   both  fit  the  history  '],[717.578,'  However '],[718.412,'   rule   number nine  will  be  selected  because  it  is  longer  '],[722.598,'  Therefore '],[723.508,'   W  will  be  played  in  the  next  period '],[725.948,'   as  prescribed  by  rule   number nine  '],[729.263,'  For  the  example  above '],[730.848,'   how  can  we  change  the  rule  set  to  ensure  that  Y  is  played  next  period  '],[736.028,'  There  are  several  ways  to  make  changes  to  the  rule  set  in  order  for  Y  to  be  played  '],[741.667,'  First '],[742.390,'   you  can  delete  Rule   number nine '],[744.485,'   which  would  cause  Rule   number four  to  be  the  longest  rule  that  fits  the  history '],[748.805,'   and  therefore  would  lead  to  Y  being  played  next  period  '],[757.899,'  Second '],[758.680,'   you  can  add  a  longer  rule  that  fits  the  history  that  has  Y  as  the  output  '],[763.789,'  Since  you  added  a  longer  rule  that  fits  the  history '],[766.877,'   that  rule  will  be  used  to  make  the  choice '],[769.277,'   and  will  select  Y  as  the  choice  for  next  period  '],[778.569,'  Number  of  Periods  Per  Match '],[780.998,'  The  number  of  periods  in  each  match  will  be  determined  randomly  using  the  following  procedure  '],[786.895,'  At  the  end  of  each  period '],[788.548,'   a  number  will  be  chosen  randomly  from  the  set  of  numbers   '],[792.084,' one '],[792.844,' two '],[793.544,' three '],[794.336,'   up  to '],[795.211,' forty eight '],[796.243,' forty nine '],[797.475,' fifty '],[798.396,'   where  each  number  is  equally  likely  '],[801.517,'  If  the  number  is  one '],[803.096,'   then  the  match  will  end  '],[805.454,'  If  the  number  is  not  one '],[807.309,'   then  the  match  will  continue  '],[809.963,'  The  number  will  always  be  placed  back  into  the  set  after  it  is  drawn  '],[814.757,'  Thus '],[815.435,'   in  any  period  there  is  a  two  percent  CHANCE  that  the  match  will  end '],[819.230,'   and  a  ninety eight  percent  CHANCE  that  the  match  will  have  another  period  '],[824.006,'  Therefore '],[824.915,'   the  expected  number  of  periods  in  each  match  will  be  fifty  '],[829.425,'  This  procedure  has  been  performed  on  the  computer  before  the  experiment  '],[834.481,'  Therefore '],[835.386,'   you  will  not  see  the  number  selected  from   '],[837.592,' one '],[838.352,' two '],[839.053,' three '],[839.844,'   up  to '],[840.719,' forty eight '],[841.749,' forty nine '],[842.980,' fifty '],[844.842,'  To  ensure  that  the  length  of  the  match  is  not  dependent  on  your  play '],[848.436,'   the  number  of  periods  for  each  match  has  be  written  on  the  board  before  the  experiment '],[853.039,'   and  will  be  uncovered  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[856.731,'  Your  choices  will  be  determined  automatically  from  your  rule  set  '],[861.168,'  However '],[862.001,'   you  will  need  to  confirm  the  choice  within  an  allotted  amount  of  time  '],[866.380,'  To  confirm  your  choice '],[867.969,'   click  on  your  action  for  the  next  period  within  the  history  at  the  top  of  the  screen  '],[873.411,'  If  you  don\'t  confirm  the  choice  within  the  allotted  amount  of  time '],[877.128,'   then  the  choice  will  be  confirmed  automatically  at  the  end  of  the  allotted  time  '],[882.042,'  The  experiment  will  not  be  able  to  proceed  until  everyone  confirms  their  choices  '],[887.699,'  Everyone  in  your  group  will  have  the  same  amount  of  time  allotted  in  each  period  '],[893.820,'  Additional  Information  about  Matches '],[896.718,'  During  matches  one  through  ten  you  will  be  able  to  construct  the  set  of  rules  to  make  your  choices  '],[902.718,'  All  of  the  rules  in  your  set  at  the  end  of  one  match  will  remain  in  your  set  at  the  start  of  the  next  match  '],[909.030,'  Before  the  first  match '],[910.608,'   you  will  have  one  minute  to  look  over  the  payoffs '],[913.116,'   and  an  additional  ten  minute  to  construct  your  rules  '],[917.450,'  Editing  your  set  of  rules '],[919.583,'  In  the  experiment  today  you  will  need  to  pay  a  cost  to  edit  rules  during  the  match  '],[925.011,'  More  specifically '],[926.414,'   Before  each  match  starts '],[928.112,'   you  can  make  changes  to  your  set  of  rules  at  no  cost  '],[932.277,'  After  each  match  starts '],[933.967,'   if  you  want  to  make  changes  to  your  set  of  rules '],[936.706,'   you  must  click  the  Unlock  Rules  button  '],[939.833,'  The  cost  for  clicking  the  Unlock  Rules  button  is  zero  Francs  '],[944.569,'  The  total  cost  incurred  in  all  matches  will  be  displayed  at  the  top  of  the  screen  in  red  '],[950.352,'  You  will  be  able  to  edit  your  rules  for  the  duration  of  one  period  '],[955.013,'  Once  you  are  done  editing  your  rules  you  may  click  the  Lock  Rules  button  '],[959.565,'  If  you  don\'t  want  to  make  changes  to  your  set  of  rules '],[962.552,'   you  may  choose  not  to  click  the  Unlock  Rule  button  '],[966.133,'  Then  you  will  not  incur  the  cost  of  zero  Francs  '],[970.031,'  In  either  case '],[971.133,'   you  will  need  to  confirm  the  choice  made  within  the  time  limit  set  for  each  period  '],[976.145,'  If  the  time  limit  within  a  period  is  reached '],[978.769,'   your  rules  will  become  locked '],[980.674,'   your  choice  will  be  confirmed  automatically '],[983.123,'   and  you  will  proceed  to  the  next  period  '],[986.904,'  Starting  Rules '],[988.664,'  Prior  to  the  start  of  the  experiment  you  will  have  ten  minutes  to  construct  your  starting  set  of  rules  '],[995.059,'  During  that  time '],[996.217,'   you  will  be  presented  with  a  split screen  view  of  of  the  construction  screen  '],[1001.131,'  In  this  view '],[1002.197,'   you  will  have  an  opportunity  to  test  what  your  rule  set  will  select  as  an  output  for  a  variety  of  hypothetical  histories  '],[1009.740,'  The  split screen  will  consist  of  two  sides  '],[1013.394,'  The  right  side  is  the  Starting  Rules  side  '],[1017.008,'  Rules  added  to  this  side  will  be  added  to  your  rule  set  at  the  start  of  the  first  match  '],[1022.334,'  The  left  side  is  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side  '],[1026.135,'  Rules  added  to  this  side  can  be  used  to  test  to  see  what  choices  different  combinations  of  rules  will  lead  to  '],[1033.253,'  You  will  be  able  to  move  rules  from  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side  to  the  Starting  Rules  side  by  clicking  the  blue  move  button  '],[1040.804,'  To  delete  rules  from  either  side '],[1042.973,'   you  need  to  click  the  delete  button  '],[1045.776,'  You  will  be  able  to  see  what  choice  your  hypothetical '],[1048.706,'   and  your  starting  rule  sets  select  as  a  choice  for  next  period '],[1052.202,'   for  each  of  the  hypothetical  histories  that  you  construct  '],[1056.440,'  Notice  that  you  will  be  able  to  construct '],[1058.821,'   and  store '],[1059.639,'   multiple  histories  at  the  same  time  '],[1063.034,'  You  can  view  one  of  the  other  hypothetical  histories  by  clicking  the  History   number   button  at  the  top  of  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side  '],[1071.327,'  You  can  add  a  new  hypothetical  history  by  clicking  the  New  button  at  the  top  of  the  Hypothetical  Rules  side  '],[1078.245,'  To  construct  a  hypothetical  history  you  will  need  to  click  on  the  question  marks  in  that  history  '],[1084.547,'  You  don\'t  need  to  fill  out  the  entire  history  to  see  what  choice  your  rule  set  will  make  '],[1090.183,'  Therefore '],[1091.090,'   it  is  useful  to  start  filling  out  the  new  histories  from  the  most  recent  periods  on  the  right  side  '],[1097.434,'  Let\'s  look  at  an  example  '],[1100.133,'  Five  periods  of  hypothetical  History   number four  have  been  filled  in  '],[1105.397,'  The  hypothetical  rule  set  will  play  W  after  this  history  occurs  '],[1110.608,'  The  starting  rule  set  will  play  Y  after  this  history  occurs  '],[1120.354,'  Let\'s  look  at  another  example  '],[1123.296,'  fourteen  periods  of  hypothetical  History   number three  have  been  filled  in  '],[1128.707,'  The  hypothetical  rule  set  will  play  Y  after  this  history  occurs  '],[1133.792,'  The  starting  rule  set  will  play  Y  after  this  history  occurs  '],[1143.536,'  You  will  be  able  to  make  changes  to  your  Hypothetical  Rules '],[1146.943,'   and  your  Starting  Rules '],[1148.495,'   for  the  duration  of  the  ten  minutes  '],[1151.596,'  After  the  ten  minutes  are  up '],[1153.273,'   rules  that  are  on  the  Starting  Rules  side  will  be  your  starting  rules  for  the  experiment  '],[1159.633,'  Payoffs '],[1160.996,'  At  the  end  of  the  experiment '],[1162.898,'   you  will  be  paid  in  cash  '],[1165.510,'  Your  payoff  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  will  be  the  sum  of  the  payoffs  for  each  period  '],[1171.095,'  Reminder '],[1172.010,'   the  exchange  rate  today  is  one thousand two hundred and fifty  Francs  equals  one  dollar  '],[1178.255,'  Practice  Match '],[1179.876,'  Next '],[1180.673,'   there  will  be  a  practice  match  to  make  sure  that  you  are  comfortable  with  the  interface  '],[1185.884,'  It  is  important  to  note  that  in  this  practice  match '],[1188.890,'   you  will  NOT  be  paid  for  the  choices  made  '],[1192.196,'  the  payoffs  are  all  listed  as  zero '],[1194.661,'   so  that  you  can  focus  on  getting  comfortable  with  the  interface '],[1198.051,'   rather  than  focusing  on  the  payoffs  '],[1201.259,'  You  are  NOT  paired  with  another  participant  '],[1204.676,'  Your  opponent  for  the  practice  match  is  a  computer  that  is  playing  RANDOMLY  '],[1210.127,'']];
